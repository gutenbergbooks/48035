<div class="medium">

<p>Through the influence of the late Dr. James W. Stone, an indefatigable
Republican, a course of lectures was organized in Boston especially
for the discussion of Slavery. This course marks the breaking of
the seal on the platform. Mr. Sumner undertook to open this course,
which was to begin in the week after his address before the Mercantile
Library Association; but he was prevented by sudden disability from
a cold. His excuse was contained in the following letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Hancock Street</span>, 23d November, 1854.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;An unkindly current of air is often more penetrating
than an arrow. From such a shaft I suffered on the night of my address to
the Mercantile Library Association, more than a week ago, and no care or
skill has been efficacious to relieve me. I am admonished alike by painful
consciousness and by the good physician into whose hands I have fallen, that
I am not equal to the service I have undertaken on Thursday evening.</p>

<p>“Fitly to inaugurate that course of lectures would task the best powers
in best health of any man. Most reluctantly, but necessarily, I must lose
sight of the inspiring company there assembled in the name of Freedom
to sit in judgment on Slavery, and postpone till some other opportunity
what I had hoped to say. You, who know the effort I have made to rally
for this occasion, will appreciate my personal disappointment.</p>

<p>“It is my habit to keep my engagements. Not for a single day have I been
absent from my seat in the Senate during the three sessions in which duty
has called me there; and never before, in the course of numerous undertakings
to address public bodies, at different times and in different places, has
there been any failure through remissness or disability on my part.</p>

<p>“Pardon these allusions, which I make that you may better understand
my feelings, now that I am compelled to depart for the moment from a
cherished rule of fidelity.</p>

<p class="sig2">“Ever faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="sig3">“<span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dr. Stone.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>Failing to open the course, Mr. Sumner closed it, on his return from
Washington in the spring, with the following address, which he was
called to repeat in the same hall a few days later. Yielding to friendly
pressure, he consented to repeat it at several places in New York,
among which was Auburn, the residence of Mr. Seward, by whom he
was introduced to the audience in the following words.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Fellow-Citizens</span>,&mdash;A dozen years ago I was honored by being chosen
to bring my neighbors residing here to the acquaintance of a statesman of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>Massachusetts who was then directing the last energies of an illustrious life
to the removal of the crime of Human Slavery from the soil of our beloved
country,&mdash;a statesman whose course I had chosen for my own guidance,&mdash;John
Quincy Adams, ‘the old man eloquent.’</p>

<p>“He has ascended to heaven: you and I yet remain here, in the field of
toil and duty. And now, by a rare felicity, I have your instructions to present
to you another statesman of Massachusetts, him on whose shoulders
the mantle of the departed one has fallen, and who more than any other of
the many great and virtuous citizens of his native Commonwealth illustrates
the spirit of the teacher whom, like us, he venerated and loved so much,&mdash;a
companion and friend of my own public labors,&mdash;the <em>young</em> ‘man eloquent,’&mdash;Charles
Sumner.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the city of New York the same address formed the last of an
Antislavery course. It was delivered in the Metropolitan Theatre,
before a crowded audience, May 9, 1855. Mr. Sumner had never before
spoken in New York. He was introduced by Hon. William Jay, in
the following words.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I have been requested, on the part of the
Society, to perform the pleasing, but unnecessary, office of introducing to you
the honored and well-known advocate of Justice, Humanity, and Freedom,
Charles Sumner. It is not for his learning and eloquence that I commend
him to your respectful attention; for learning, eloquence, and even
theology itself, have been prostituted in the service of an institution well
described by John Wesley as the sum of all villanies. I introduce him to
you as a Northern Senator on whom Nature has conferred the unusual gift
of a backbone,&mdash;a man who, standing erect on the floor of Congress, amid
creeping things from the North, with Christian fidelity denounces the stupendous
wickedness of the Fugitive Law and the Nebraska Perfidy, and in
the name of Liberty, Humanity, and Religion demands the repeal of those
most atrocious enactments. May the words he is about to utter be impressed
on your consciences and influence your conduct.”</p>

</div>

<p>The reception of the address attested the change in the public mind.
Frederick Douglass, who was present, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Metropolitan Theatre was literally packed, and, for two hours and a half,
the vast audience, with attention unwearied, and with interest rising with
every sentence which dropped from the speaker, indorsed sentiments which
many of the same parties would five years ago have stoned any one for
uttering.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Tribune</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner’s speech last night was the greatest oratorical and logical
success of the year, and was most enthusiastically praised by the largest
audience yet gathered in New York to hear a lecture.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p>The interest was such, that he was constrained, much against his
own disposition, to repeat it in Brooklyn, where he was introduced by
Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, and then again at Niblo’s Theatre, New
York, where he was introduced by Joseph Blunt, Esq. The concluding
words of Mr. Beecher were as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am to introduce to you a statesman who follows a long train of representatives
and statesmen who were false to the North, false to Liberty;
and then they made a complaint that there was no North! It was because
the North lost faith in her recreant children. It lost faith in its traitors, and
not in Liberty. But now, if the haughty Southerners wish to engage in
any more conflicts of this kind, I think they will have to find some other
than the speaker to-night with whom to break a lance. [<em>Loud cheers.</em>]
I do not wish merely to introduce to you the ‘honorable gentleman’ sent
from Massachusetts as a United States Senator; my wish is to do better
than that; I wish to introduce to you the <span class="smcap">MAN</span>,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>.
[<em>Loud applause.</em>]”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Tribune</i> spoke thus of these meetings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That a lecture should be repeated in New York is a rare occurrence.
That a lecture on Antislavery should be repeated in New York, even before
a few despised ‘fanatics,’ is an unparalleled occurrence. But that
an Antislavery lecture should be repeated night after night to successive
multitudes, each more enthusiastic than the last, marks the epoch of a revolution
in popular feeling; it is an era in the history of Liberty. Niblo’s
Theatre was crowded last evening long before the hour of commencement.
Hundreds stood through the three hours’ lecture. We give a full report of
the words, but only of the words.”</p>

</div>

<p>Other newspapers were enthusiastic in their comments.</p>

<p>The <i>National Era</i>, at Washington, in printing the address, said of
its delivery in Metropolitan Hall:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner closed, as he had continued, amid loud and protracted applause.
Especially at the point when he said that the Fugitive Slave Bill
must be made a dead letter, the audience seemed wild with enthusiasm.
Handkerchiefs waved from fair hands, and reporters almost forgot their
stolid unconcern.”</p>

</div>

<p>Such extracts might be multiplied. Beyond these was the testimony
of individuals gratified at the hearing obtained for cherished sentiments.
One wrote from Philadelphia as follows.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I cannot forbear, not for your gratification, but for my own, to testify
my unbounded sympathy and satisfaction in the Three Days’ Ovation of
May that you have enjoyed in New York, in reward of your faithful sentinelship
on the ramparts of Liberty in that sin-beleaguered fortress, the
Capitol at Washington, faithfully supporting the cause of the weak against
insolence and haughty vulgarity.&hellip; You have gloriously and faithfully
withstood obloquy and reproach: the hour of triumph is now well
assured.”</p>

</div>

<p>Another wrote from Albany:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have never read anything so magnificent as your Lecture in the <em>Independent</em>.
How I wish I could have heard it! Letters from judges in such
matters inform me that no speech in New York for many years has produced
such a sensation.”</p></div>

<p>Count Gurowski, writing from Brattleboro’, Vermont, expressed his
enthusiastic sympathy, and at the same time predicted the adverse
feeling among slave-masters.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have just finished the reading of your admirable Oration. I am <em>en
extase</em>. I was near to cry.&hellip; But you have thrown the gauntlet once
more to the ‘gentlemen from the South,’ bravely, decidedly, and pitilessly.
Do not be astonished, if they shall send you, covered with laurels as you
are, to Coventry. This undoubtedly they will do.”</p>

</div>

<p>These extracts show something of public sentiment at this stage of
the great contest with Slavery. From this time forward the discussion
broadened and deepened.</p>

<h3>ADDRESS.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">History abounds in vicissitudes. From weakness
and humility, men ascend to power and place.
From defeat and disparagement, enterprises are borne
on to recognition and triumph. The martyr of to-day
is gratefully enshrined on the morrow. The stone that
the builders rejected is made head of the corner. Thus
it always has been, and ever will be.</p>

<p>Only twenty years ago, in 1835, the friends of the
slave in our country were weak and humble, while
their great undertaking, just then showing itself, was
trampled down and despised. Small companies, gathered
together in the name of Freedom, were interrupted
and often dispersed by riotous mobs. At Boston, a
feeble association of women, called the Female Antislavery
Society, sitting in a small room of an upper
story in an obscure building, was insulted and then
driven out of doors by a frantic crowd, politely termed
at the time “gentlemen of property and standing,”
which, after various deeds of violence and vileness, next
directed itself upon William Lloyd Garrison,&mdash;known
as the determined editor of the “Liberator,” and originator
of the Antislavery Enterprise in our day,&mdash;then
ruthlessly tearing him away, amidst savage threats and
with a halter about his neck, dragged him through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
streets, until, at last, guilty only of loving liberty, if not
wisely, too well, this unoffending citizen was thrust into
the common jail for protection against an infuriate populace.
Nor was Boston alone. Even villages in remote
rural solitude broke out in similar outrage,&mdash;while
large towns, like Providence, New Haven, Utica, Worcester,
Alton, Cincinnati, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and
New York, became so many fiery craters overflowing
with rage and madness. What lawless violence failed
to accomplish was urged next through forms of law.
By solemn legislative acts, the Slave States called on
the Free States “promptly and effectually to suppress
all those associations within their respective limits purporting
to be Abolition Societies”;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and Rhode Island,
Massachusetts, and New York basely hearkened to the
base proposition. The press, too, with untold power,
exerted itself in this behalf, while pulpit, politician, and
merchant conspired to stifle discussion, until the voice of
Freedom was hushed to a whisper, “alas! almost afraid
to know itself.”</p>

<p>Since then, in the lapse of few years only, a change
has taken place. Instead of those small companies,
counted by tens, we have now this mighty assembly,
counted by thousands; instead of an insignificant apartment,
like that in Boston, the mere appendage of a
printing-office, where, as in the manger itself, Truth was
cradled, we have this Metropolitan Hall, ample in proportion
and central in place; instead of a profane and
clamorous mob, beating at our gates, dispersing our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
assembly, and making one of our number the victim
of its fury, we have peace and harmony at unguarded
doors, ruffled only by generous competition to participate
in this occasion; while Legislatures openly declare
their sympathies, villages, towns, and cities vie in the
new manifestation, and the press itself, with increased
power, heralds, applauds, and extends the prevailing
influence, which, gushing from every fountain, and pouring
through every channel, at last, by quickening power
of pulpit, politician, and merchant, swells into an irresistible
tide.</p>

<p>Here is a great change, worthy of notice and memory,
for it attests the first stage of victory. Slavery, in all
its many-sided wrong, still continues; but here in this
metropolis&mdash;ay, Sir, and throughout the whole North&mdash;freedom
of discussion is at length secured. And this,
I say, is the first stage of victory,&mdash;herald of the transcendent
future.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">A God! a God! the vocal hills reply:</div>
<div class="verse">The rocks proclaim the approaching Deity.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nor is there anything peculiar in the trials to which
our cause has been exposed. Thus in all ages is Truth
encountered. At first persecuted, gagged, silenced, crucified,
she cries out from the prison, the rack, the stake,
the cross, until at last her voice is heard. And when
that voice is really heard, whether in martyr cries, or in
earthquake tones of civil convulsion, or in the calmness
of ordinary speech, such as I now employ, or in that
still, small utterance inaudible to the common ear, then
is the beginning of victory! “Give me where to stand
and I will move the world,” said Archimedes; and
Truth asks no more than did the master of geometry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>Viewed in this aspect, the present occasion rises above
any ordinary course of lectures or series of political meetings.
It is the inauguration of Freedom. From this
time forward, her voice of warning and command cannot
be silenced. The sensitive sympathies of property, in
this commercial mart, may yet again recognize property
in man; the watchful press itself may falter or fail; but
the vantage-ground of free discussion now achieved cannot
be lost. On this I take my stand, and, as from the
Mount of Vision, behold the whole field of our great controversy
spread before me. There is no point, topic, fact,
matter, reason, or argument, touching the question between
Slavery and Freedom, which is not now open.
From these I might aptly select some one, and confine
myself to its development. But I should not in this
way best satisfy the seeming requirement of the occasion.
According to the invitation of your Committee,
I was to make an address introductory to the present
course of lectures, but was prevented by ill-health. And
now, at the close of the course, I am to say what I failed
to say at its beginning. Not as Caucus or as Congress
can I address you; nor am I moved to undertake a political
harangue or constitutional argument. Out of the
occasion let me speak, and, discarding any individual
topic, aim to exhibit the entire field, in its divisions and
subdivisions, with metes and bounds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My subject will be <span class="smcap">The Necessity, Practicability,
and Dignity of the Antislavery Enterprise, with
Glances at Special Duties of the North</span>. By this
enterprise I do not mean the efforts of any restricted
circle, sect, or party, but the cause of the slave, in all its
forms and under all its names,&mdash;whether inspired by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
pulpit, press, economist, or politician,&mdash;whether in the
early, persistent, and comprehensive demands of Garrison,
the gentler tones of Channing, or the strictly constitutional
endeavors of others now actually sharing
the public councils of the country. To carry through
this review, under its different heads, I shall not hesitate
to meet the objections urged against it, so far at least as
I am aware of them. As I speak to you seriously, I
venture to ask your serious attention even to the end.
Not easily can a public address reach that highest completeness
which is found in mingling the useful and the
agreeable; but I desire to say that it will be my effort
to cultivate that highest courtesy of a speaker which is
found in clearness.</p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>I begin with the <span class="smcap">NECESSITY</span> of the Antislavery Enterprise.
In the wrong of Slavery, <em>as defined by existing
law</em>, this necessity is plainly apparent; nor can any man
within the sound of my voice, who listens to the authentic
words of the law, hesitate in my conclusion. A wrong
so grievous and unquestionable should not be allowed to
continue. For the honor of human nature, and the good
of all concerned, <em>it must at once cease</em>. On this simple
statement, as corner-stone, I found the necessity of the
Antislavery Enterprise.</p>

<p>I do not dwell, Sir, on the many tales which come from
the house of bondage: on the bitter sorrows undergone;
on the flesh galled by manacle, or spurting blood beneath
the lash; on the human form mutilated by knife, or
seared by red-hot iron; on the ferocious scent of bloodhounds
in chase of human prey; on the sale of fathers
and mothers, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
little children, even infants, at the auction block; on
the practical prostration of all rights, all ties, and even
all hope; on the deadly injury to morals, substituting
concubinage for marriage, and changing the whole land
of Slavery into a by-word of shame, only fitly pictured
by the language of Dante, when he called his own degraded
country a House of Ill Fame;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and, last of all,
on the pernicious influence upon master as well as slave,
showing itself too often, even by his own confession, in
rudeness of manners and character, and especially in
that blindness which renders him insensible to the
wrongs he upholds. On these things I do not dwell,
although volumes are at hand of unquestionable fact,
and also of illustrative story so just and germane as to
vie with fact, out of which I might draw, until, like
Macbeth, you had “supped full with horrors.”</p>

<p>All these I put aside,&mdash;not because I do not regard
them of moment in exhibiting the true character of
Slavery, but because I desire to present this argument
on grounds above all controversy, impeachment, or suspicion,
even from slave-masters themselves. Not on
triumphant story, not even on indisputable fact, do I
now accuse Slavery, but on its character, as revealed
in its own simple definition of itself. Out of its own
mouth do I condemn it. By the <em>Law of Slavery</em>, man,
created in the image of God, is divested of the human
character, and declared to be a mere chattel. That this
statement may not seem to be put forward without precise
authority, I quote the law of two different States.
The Civil Code of Louisiana thus defines a slave:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A slave is one who is in the power of a master to whom
he belongs. The master may sell him, dispose of his person,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
his industry, and his labor. He can do nothing, possess
nothing, nor acquire anything but what must belong to his
master.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The law of another polished Slave State gives this
definition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Slaves shall be deemed, sold, taken, reputed, and adjudged
in law to be <em>chattels personal</em>, in the hands of their
owners and possessors, and their executors, administrators,
and assigns, to all intents, constructions, and purposes whatsoever.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And a careful writer, Judge Stroud, in a work of juridical
as well as philanthropic merit, thus sums up the
law:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The cardinal principle of Slavery, that the slave is not
to be ranked among <em>sentient beings</em>, but among <em>things</em>, is an
article of property, a chattel personal, obtains as undoubted
law in all of these [Slave] States.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Sir, this is enough. As out of its small egg crawls
forth the slimy, scaly, reptile crocodile, so out of this
simple definition crawls forth the whole slimy, scaly,
reptile monstrosity by which a man is changed into a
chattel, a person is converted into a thing, a soul is
transmuted into merchandise. According to this very
definition, the slave is held simply for the good of his
master, to whose behest his life, liberty, and happiness
are devoted, and by whom he may be bartered, leased,
mortgaged, bequeathed, invoiced, shipped as cargo, stored
as goods, sold on execution, knocked off at public auction,
and even staked at the gaming-table on the hazard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
of a card or die. The slave may seem to have a
wife; but he has not, for his wife belongs to his master.
He may seem to have a child; but he has not, for
his child is owned by his master. He may be filled with
desire of knowledge, opening to him the gates of joy
on earth and in heaven; but the master may impiously
close all these gates. Thus is he robbed, not merely of
privileges, but of himself,&mdash;not merely of money and
labor, but of wife and children,&mdash;not merely of time and
opportunity, but of every assurance of happiness,&mdash;not
merely of earthly hope, but of all those divine aspirations
that spring from the Fountain of Light. He is not
merely restricted in liberty, but totally deprived of it,&mdash;not
merely curtailed in rights, but absolutely stripped
of them,&mdash;not merely loaded with burdens, but changed
into a beast of burden,&mdash;not merely bent in countenance
to the earth, but sunk in law to the level of a quadruped,&mdash;not
merely exposed to personal cruelty, but deprived
of his character as a person,&mdash;not merely compelled to
involuntary labor, but degraded to a rude thing,&mdash;not
merely shut out from knowledge, but wrested from his
place in the human family. <em>And all this, Sir, is according
to the simple Law of Slavery.</em></p>

<p>And even this is not all. The law, by cumulative
provisions, positively forbids that a slave shall be taught
to read. Hear this, fellow-citizens, and confess that no
barbarity of despotism, no extravagance of tyranny, no
excess of impiety can be more blasphemous or deadly.
“Train up a child in the way he should go” is the lesson
of Divine Wisdom; but the Law of Slavery boldly
prohibits any such training, and dooms the child to
hopeless ignorance and degradation. “Let there be
light” was the Divine behest at the dawn of Creation,&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
this commandment, travelling with the ages
and the hours, still speaks with the voice of God; yet
the Law of Slavery says, “Let there be darkness.”</p>

<p>But it is earnestly averred that slave-masters are humane,
and slaves are treated with kindness. These averments,
however, I properly put aside, precisely as I have
already put aside the multitudinous illustrations from
the cruelty of Slavery. On the simple <em>letter of the law</em>
I take my stand, and do not go beyond what is there
nominated. The masses of men are not better than
their laws, and, whatever may be the eminence of individual
virtue, it is not reasonable to infer that the
body of slave-masters is better than the Law of Slavery.
And since this law submits the slave to their irresponsible
control, with power to bind and to scourge, to shut
the soul from knowledge, to separate families, to unclasp
the infant from a mother’s breast, and the wife
from a husband’s arms, it is natural to conclude that
such enormities are sanctioned by them, while the supplementary
denial of instruction gives conclusive evidence
of their full complicity. And this conclusion
must exist unquestioned, just so long as the law exists
unrepealed. Cease, then, to blazon the humanity of
slave-masters. Tell me not of the lenity with which
this cruel law is tempered to its unhappy subjects.
Tell me not of the sympathy which overflows from the
mansion of the master to the cabin of the slave. In
vain you assert these instances. In vain you show that
there are individuals who do not exert the wickedness
of the law. The law still endures. Slavery, which it
defines and upholds, continues to outrage Public Opinion,
and, within the limits of our Republic, more than
three millions of human beings, guilty only of a skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
not colored like your own, are left the victims of its
unrighteous, irresponsible power.</p>

<p>Power divorced from right is devilish; power without
the check of responsibility is tyrannical; and I
need not go back to the authority of Plato, when I assert
that the most complete injustice is that erected
into the form of law. But all these things concur in
Slavery. It is, then, on the testimony of slave-masters,
solemnly, legislatively, judicially attested in the very
law itself, that I now arraign this institution as an outrage
upon man and his Creator. And herein is the
necessity of the Antislavery Enterprise. A wrong so
transcendent, so loathsome, so direful, must be encountered,
<em>wherever it can be reached</em>; and the battle must
be continued without truce or compromise, until the
field is entirely won. Freedom and Slavery can hold
no divided empire; nor can there be any true repose,
until Freedom is everywhere established.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To the <em>necessity</em> of the Antislavery Enterprise there
are two, and only two, main objections,&mdash;one founded
on the alleged distinction of race, and the other on the
alleged sanction of Christianity. All other objections
are of inferior character, or are directed logically at its
<em>practicability</em>. Of these two main objections let me
briefly speak.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. I begin with the alleged <em>distinction of race</em>. This
objection assumes two different forms,&mdash;one founded on
a prophetic malediction in the Old Testament, and the
other on professed observations of recent science. Its
importance is apparent in the obvious fact, that, unless
such distinction be clearly and unmistakably established,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
every argument by which our own freedom is vindicated,
every applause awarded to the successful rebellion of
our fathers, every indignant word ever hurled against
the enslavement of white fellow-citizens by Algerine
corsairs, must plead trumpet-tongued against the deep
damnation of Slavery, black as well as white.</p>

<p>It is said that Africans are the posterity of Ham, son
of Noah, through Canaan cursed by Noah, to be the
servant of his brethren, and that this malediction has
fallen upon all his descendants, including the unhappy
Africans,&mdash;who are accordingly devoted by God, through
unending generations, to unending bondage. Such is
the favorite argument at the South, and more than once
directly addressed to myself. Here, for instance, is a
passage from a letter recently received. “You need not
persist,” says the writer, “in confounding Japheth’s children
with Ham’s, and making both races one, and arguing
on their rights as those of man broadly.” And I
have been seriously assured, that, until this objection is
answered, it will be vain to press my views upon Congress
or the country. Listen now to the texts of the Old
Testament which are so strangely employed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And he [Noah] said, Cursed be Canaan: a servant of servants
shall he be unto his brethren. And he said, Blessed
be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of
Shem, and Canaan shall be his servant.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

</div>

<p>That is all; and I need only read these words in order
to expose the whole&mdash;transpicuous humbug. I am
tempted to add, that, to justify this objection, it is necessary
to maintain at least five different propositions,
as essential links in the chain of the African slave: <em>first</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
that by this malediction Canaan himself was actually
changed into a <em>chattel</em>,&mdash;whereas he is simply made the
servant of his brethren; <em>secondly</em>, that not merely Canaan,
but all his posterity, to the remotest generation, was so
changed,&mdash;whereas the language has no such extent;
<em>thirdly</em>, that the African actually belongs to the posterity
of Canaan,&mdash;an ethnographical assumption absurdly
difficult to establish; <em>fourthly</em>, that each descendant of
Shem and Japheth has a right to hold an African fellow-man
as chattel,&mdash;a proposition which finds no semblance
of support; and, <em>fifthly</em>, that every slave-master
is truly descended from Shem or Japheth,&mdash;a pedigree
which no anxiety or assurance can prove. This plain
analysis, which may fitly excite a smile, shows the fivefold
absurdity of an attempt to found this revolting
wrong on any</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent2">“successive title, long and dark,</div>
<div class="verse">Drawn from the mouldy rolls of Noah’s ark.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The small bigotry which finds comfort in these texts
has been exalted lately by the voice of Science, undertaking
to suggest that the different races of men are not
derived from a single pair, but from several distinct
stocks, according to their several distinct characteristics;
and it is haughtily argued, that the African is so far
inferior as to lose all title to that liberty which is the
birthright of the lordly white. Now I have neither time
nor disposition, on this occasion, to discuss the question
of the unity of races; nor is it necessary to my present
purpose. It may be that the different races of men proceeded
from different stocks; but there is but <em>one</em> great
Human Family, in which Caucasian and African, Chinese
and Indian, are all brothers, children of <em>one</em> Father, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
heirs to <em>one</em> happiness,&mdash;alike on earth and in heaven.
“Star-eyed Science” cannot shake this everlasting truth.
It may exhibit peculiarities in the African, by which he
is distinguishable from the Caucasian. In his physical
form and intellectual character it may presume to find
the stamp of permanent inferiority. But by no reach
of learning, no torture of fact, no effrontery of dogma,
can any science show that he is not <em>a man</em>. And as
a man he stands before you an unquestionable member
of the Human Family, entitled to <em>all the rights of man</em>.
You can claim nothing for yourself, <em>as man</em>, which you
must not accord to him. <em>Life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness</em>, which you proudly declare to be your
own inalienable, God-given rights, and to the support
of which your fathers pledged their lives, fortunes, and
sacred honor, are his by the same immortal title that
they are yours.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>2. From the objection founded on alleged distinction
of race, I pass to that other founded on alleged <em>sanction
of Slavery by Christianity</em>. Striving to be brief, I shall
not undertake to reconcile texts often quoted from the
Old Testament, which, whatever their import, are all absorbed
in the New; nor shall I stop to consider the precise
interpretation of the familiar phrase, <em>Servants, obey
your masters</em>, nor seek to weigh any such imperfect injunction
in the scales against those grand commandments
on which hang all the Law and the Prophets. Surely, in
the example and teachings of the Saviour, who lifted up
the down-trodden, who enjoined purity of life, and overflowed
with tenderness even to little children, human
ingenuity can find no apology for an institution which
tramples on man, which defiles woman, and sweeps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
little children beneath the hammer of the auctioneer.
If to any one these things seem to have the license of
Christianity, it is only because they have first secured a
license in his own soul. Men are prone in uncertain,
disconnected texts to find confirmation of their own personal
prejudices or prepossessions. And I&mdash;who am
no theologian, but only a simple layman&mdash;make bold to
say, that whoever finds in the Gospel any sanction of
Slavery finds there merely a reflection of himself. On
a matter so irresistibly clear authority is superfluous;
but an eminent character, who as poet makes us forget
his high place as philosopher, and as philosopher makes
us forget his high place as theologian, exposes the essential
antagonism between Christianity and Slavery in a
few pregnant words, which, by recalling the spirit of our
Faith, are more satisfactory than whole volumes of ingenious
discussion. “By a principle essential to Christianity,”
says Coleridge, “a <em>person</em> is eternally differenced
from a <em>thing</em>; so that <em>the idea of a Human Being
necessarily excludes the idea of property in that Being</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>With regret, though not with astonishment, I learn
that a Boston divine has sought to throw the seamless
garment of Christ over this shocking wrong. But I am
patient, and see clearly how vain is his effort, when I
call to mind, that, within this very century, other divines
in another country sought to throw the same sacred
vesture over the more shocking slave-trade,&mdash;and that,
among many publications, a little book was then put
forth by a reverend clergyman, with the title, “The
African Trade for Negro Slaves shewn to be consistent
with Principles of Humanity and with the Laws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
of Revealed Religion.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Thinking of these things, I am
ready to say, with Shakespeare,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent10">“In religion,</div>
<div class="verse">What damnèd error, but some sober brow</div>
<div class="verse">Will bless it, and approve it with a text?”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In support of Slavery, it is the habit to pervert texts
and to invent authority. Even St. Paul is vouched for
a wrong which his Christian life rebukes. Much stress
is now laid on his example, as it appears in the Epistle
to Philemon, written at Rome, and sent by Onesimus, a
servant. From the single chapter constituting the entire
epistle I take the following ten verses, most strangely
invoked for Slavery.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<em>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus</em>, whom I have begotten
in my bonds; which in time past was to thee unprofitable,
but now profitable to thee and to me; whom I have sent
again. Thou, therefore, receive him, that is, mine own bowels:
whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he
might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel;
but without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit
should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. For perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>he therefore departed for a season that thou shouldest
receive him forever; <em>not now as a servant, but above a servant,
a brother beloved</em>, specially to me, but how much more unto
thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord! <em>If thou count me,
therefore, a partner, receive him as myself.</em> If he hath wronged
thee, or oweth thee aught, put that on mine account: I
Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it:
albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even
thine own self besides.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Out of this affectionate epistle, where St. Paul calls
the converted servant, Onesimus, his <em>son</em>, precisely as in
another epistle he calls Timothy his son, Slavery is elaborately
vindicated, and the great Apostle to the Gentiles
made the very tutelary saint of the Slave-Hunter. Now,
without invoking his real judgment of Slavery from his
condemnation on another occasion of “men-stealers,” or
what I prefer to call <em>slave-hunters</em>, in company with
“murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers,” and
without undertaking to show that the present epistle,
when truly interpreted, is a protest against Slavery and
a voice for Freedom,&mdash;all of which might be done,&mdash;I
content myself with calling attention to two things,
apparent on its face, and in themselves an all-sufficient
response. <i>First</i>, while it appears that Onesimus had
been in some way the servant of Philemon, it does not
appear that he was ever held as <em>chattel</em>; and how gross
and monstrous is the effort to derive such a wrong out
of words, whether in the Constitution of our country or
in the Bible, which do not explicitly, unequivocally, and
exclusively define this wrong! <i>Secondly</i>, in charging
Onesimus with this epistle to Philemon, the Apostle
recommends him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span> “not now a servant, but above a
servant, a brother beloved,” and he enjoins upon his
correspondent the hospitality due to a freeman, saying
expressly, “If thou count me, therefore, a partner, <em>receive
him as myself</em>”: ay, Sir, not as slave, not even as servant,
but as brother beloved, even as the Apostle himself.
Thus, with apostolic pen, wrote Paul to his disciple,
Philemon. In these words of gentleness, benediction,
and equal rights, dropping with celestial, soul-awakening
power, there can be no justification for a conspiracy,
which, beginning with the treachery of Iscariot
and the temptation of pieces of silver, seeks, by fraud,
brutality, and violence, through officers of the law armed
to the teeth, like pirates, and amidst soldiers who degrade
their uniform, to hurl a fellow-man back into the lash-resounding
den of American Slavery; and when any
one thus perverts this beneficent example, allow me to
say that he gives too much occasion to doubt his intelligence
or his sincerity.</p>

<p>Certainly I am right in stripping from Slavery the
apology of Christianity, which it has tenaciously hugged;
and here I leave the first part of my subject, asserting,
against every objection, the Necessity of our Enterprise.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>I am now brought, in the <em>second</em> place, to the <span class="smcap">Practicability</span>
of the Enterprise. And here the way is easy.
In showing its necessity, I have already demonstrated its
practicability; for the former includes the latter, as the
greater includes the less. Whatever is necessary must
be practicable. By a decree which is a proverb of tyranny,
the Israelites were compelled to make bricks without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
straw; but it is not according to the ways of a benevolent
Providence that man should be constrained to
do what cannot be done. Besides, the Antislavery Enterprise
is right; and the right is always practicable.</p>

<p>I know well the little faith of the world in the triumph
of principles, and I readily imagine the despair
with which our object is regarded; but not on this account
am I disheartened. That exuberant writer, Sir
Thomas Browne, breaks into ecstatic wish for some new
difficulty in Christian belief, that his faith may have
a new victory; and an eminent enthusiast went so far
as to say, “I believe because it is impossible,”&mdash;<em>Credo
quia impossibile</em>. No such exalted faith is now required.
Here is no impossibility; nor is there any difficulty
which will not yield to faithful, well-directed endeavor.
If to any timid soul the Enterprise seems impossible
because it is too beautiful, then do I say at once that
it is too beautiful not to be possible.</p>

<p>Descending from these summits, let me show plainly
the object it seeks to accomplish; and here you will see
and confess its complete practicability. While discountenancing
all prejudice of color and every establishment
of caste, the Antislavery Enterprise&mdash;at least so far as
I may speak for it&mdash;does not undertake to change human
nature, or to force any individual into relations of
life for which he is not morally, intellectually, and socially
adapted; nor does it necessarily assume that a
race, degraded for long generations under the iron heel
of bondage, can be taught at once all the political duties
of an American citizen. But, Sir, it does confidently
assume, against all question, contradiction, or assault
whatever, <em>that every man is entitled to life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness; and, with equal confidence, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
asserts that every individual who wears the human form,
whether black or white, should be recognized at once as
man</em>. When this is done, I know not what other trials
may be in wait for the unhappy African; but this I do
know, that the Antislavery Enterprise will then have
triumphed, and the institution of Slavery, <em>as defined by
existing law</em>, will no longer shock mankind.</p>

<p>In this work, the first essential, practical requisite is,
that the question shall be openly and frankly confronted.
Do not put it aside. Do not blink it out of sight. Do
not dodge it. Approach it. Study it. Ponder it. Deal
with it. Let it rest in the illumination of speech, conversation,
and the press. Let it fill the thoughts of the
statesman and the prayers of the pulpit. When Slavery
is thus regarded, its true character will be recognized, <em>as
a hateful assemblage of unquestionable wrongs under sanction
of existing law</em>, and good men will be moved to apply
the remedy. Already even its zealots admit that
its “abuses” should be removed. This is their word,
not mine. Alas! alas! Sir, it is these very “abuses”
that constitute its component parts, without which it
would not exist,&mdash;even as the scourges in a bundle
with the axe constituted the dread fasces of the Roman
lictor. Take away these, and the whole embodied outrage
disappears. Surely that central assumption&mdash;more
deadly than axe itself&mdash;by which man is changed into
a chattel, may be abandoned; and is not this practicable?
The associate scourges by which that transcendent
“abuse” is surrounded may, one by one, be subtracted.
The “abuse” which substitutes concubinage for marriage,
the “abuse” which annuls the parental relation,
the “abuse” which closes the portals of knowledge,
the “abuse” which tyrannically usurps all the labor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
of another, now upheld by positive law, may by positive
law be abolished. To say that this is not practicable,
in the nineteenth century, is a scandal upon mankind,
and just in proportion as these “abuses” cease to have
the sanction of law will the institution of Slavery cease
to exist. The African, whatever may be then his condition,
will no longer be the <em>slave</em> over whose wrongs and
sorrows the world throbs at times fiercely indignant, and
at times painfully sad, while with outstretched arms he
sends forth the piteous cry, “Am I not a man and a
brother?”</p>

<p>In pressing forward to this result, the inquiry is often
presented, To what extent, if any, shall compensation
be allowed to slave-masters? Clearly, if the point be
determined by <em>absolute justice</em>, not the masters, but the
slaves, are entitled to compensation; for it is the slaves
who, throughout weary generations, have been deprived
of the fruits of their toil, all constantly enriching their
masters. Besides, it seems hardly reasonable to pay
for the relinquishment of disgusting “abuses,” which,
in their aggregation, constitute the bundle of Slavery.
Pray, Sir, by what tariff, price-current, or principle of
equation, shall their several values be estimated? What
sum shall be counted out as the proper price for the
abandonment of that pretension&mdash;more indecent than
the <i>jus primæ noctis</i> of the feudal age&mdash;which leaves
woman, whether in the arms of master or slave, always
a concubine? What bribe shall be proffered for restoration
of God-given paternal rights? What money
shall be paid for taking off the padlock by which souls
are fastened down in darkness? How much for a quit-claim
to labor now meanly exacted by the strong from
the weak? And what compensation shall be awarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
for the egregious assumption, condemned by reason and
abhorred by piety, which changes man into a thing? I
put these questions without undertaking to pass upon
them. Shrinking instinctively from any recognition of
<em>rights founded on wrongs</em>, I find myself shrinking also
from any austere verdict which shall deny any means
necessary to the great consummation. Our fathers,
under Washington, did not hesitate, by Act of Congress,
to appropriate largely for the ransom of white fellow-citizens
enslaved by Algerine corsairs; and, following
this example, I am disposed to consider the question of
compensation as one of expediency, to be determined by
the exigency of the hour and the constitutional powers
of the Government,&mdash;though such is my desire to see
the disappearance of Slavery, that I could not hesitate
to build a Bridge of Gold, if necessary, for the retreating
fiend.</p>

<p>The <em>Practicability</em> of the Antislavery Enterprise is
constantly questioned, often so superficially as to be
answered at once. I shall not take time to consider
the allegation, founded on assumptions of economy,
which audaciously assumes that Slave Labor is more
advantageous than Free Labor, that Slavery is more
profitable than Freedom, for this is all exploded by official
tables of the census,&mdash;nor that other futile argument,
that the slaves are not prepared for Freedom, and
therefore should not be precipitated into this condition,
for this is no better than the ancient Greek folly,
where the anxious mother would not allow her son to
enter the water until he had learned to swim.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As against the Necessity of the Antislavery Enterprise
there were two chief objections, so also against its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Practicability there are two,&mdash;the first founded on alleged
danger to the master, and the second on alleged
damage to the slave himself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. The first objection, founded on alleged <em>danger to
the master</em>, most generally takes the extravagant form,
that the slave, if released from his present condition,
would “cut his master’s throat.” Here is a blatant
paradox, which can pass for reason only among those
who have lost their reason. With absurdity having no
parallel except in the defences of Slavery, it assumes
that the African, when treated justly, will show a vindictiveness
he does not exhibit when treated unjustly,&mdash;that,
when elevated by the blessings of Freedom, he will
develop an appetite for blood never manifested when
crushed by the curse of bondage. At present, the slave
sees his wife ravished from his arms,&mdash;sees his infant
swept away to the auction-block,&mdash;sees the heavenly
gates of knowledge shut upon him,&mdash;sees his industry
and all its fruits unjustly snatched by another,&mdash;sees
himself and his offspring doomed to servitude from
which there is no redemption; and still his master
sleeps secure. Will the master sleep less secure when
the slave no longer smarts under these revolting atrocities?
I will not trifle with your intelligence, or with
the quick-passing hour, by arguing this question.</p>

<p>There is a lofty example, brightening the historic
page, by which the seal of experience is affixed to the
conclusion of reason; and you would hardly pardon me,
if I failed to adduce it. By a single Act of Parliament
the slaves of the British West Indies were changed at
once to freedmen; and this great transition was accomplished
absolutely without personal danger of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
kind to the master. And yet the chance of danger
there was greater far than among us. In our broad
country the slaves are overshadowed by a more than
sixfold white population. Only in two States, South
Carolina and Mississippi, do the slaves outnumber the
whites, and there not greatly, while in the entire Slave
States the whites outnumber the slaves by millions. It
was otherwise in the British West Indies, where the
whites were overshadowed by a more than sixfold population.
The slaves were 800,000, while the whites
numbered only 131,000, distributed in different proportions
on the different islands. And this disproportion
has since increased rather than diminished, always
without danger to the whites. In Jamaica, the largest
of these possessions, there are now upwards of 400,000
Africans, and only 15,000 whites; in Barbadoes, the
next largest, 120,000 Africans, and only 16,000 whites;
in St. Lucia, 24,000 Africans, and only 900 whites; in
Tobago, 14,000 Africans, and only 160 whites; in Montserrat,
7,000 Africans, and only 150 whites; and in the
Grenadines, upwards of 6,000 Africans, and only about
60 whites.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> And yet the authorities in all these places
attest the good behavior of the Africans. Sir Lionel
Smith, Governor of Jamaica, in a speech to the Assembly,
declares that their conduct “amply proves how
well they have deserved the boon of Freedom”;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the
Governor of the Leeward Islands dwells on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span> “the peculiarly
rare instances of the commission of grave or sanguinary
crimes amongst the emancipated population of
these islands”;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and the Queen of England, in a speech
from the throne, has announced that the complete and
final emancipation of the Africans had “taken place
without any disturbance of public order and tranquillity.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
In this example I find new confirmation of the
rule, that the highest safety is in doing right; and thus
do I dismiss the objection founded on alleged danger to
the master.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>2. I am now brought to the second objection, founded
on alleged <em>damage to the slave</em>. It is common among
partisans of Slavery to assert that our Enterprise has
actually retarded the cause it seeks to promote; and
this paradoxical accusation, which might naturally show
itself among the rank weeds of the South, is cherished
here on our Northern soil among those who look for
any fig-leaf with which to cover indifference or tergiversation.</p>

<p>This peculiar form of complaint is an old device, instinctively
employed on other occasions, until it ceases
to be even plausible. Thus, throughout all time, has
every good cause been encountered. The Saviour was
nailed to the cross with a crown of thorns on his head,
as a disturber of that peace on earth which he came to
declare. The Disciples, while preaching the Gospel of
forgiveness and good-will, were stoned as preachers of
sedition and discord. The Reformers, who sought to
establish a higher piety and faith, were burnt at the
stake as blasphemers and infidels. Patriots, in all ages,
striving for their country’s good, have been doomed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
the scaffold or to exile, even as their country’s enemies.
Those brave Englishmen, who, at home, under the lead
of Edmund Burke, espoused the cause of our fathers,
shared the same illogical impeachment, which was
touched to the quick by that orator statesman, when,
after exposing its essential vice, in “attributing the ill
effect of ill-judged conduct to the arguments which had
been used to dissuade us from it,” he denounced it as
“absurd, but very common in modern practice, and very
wicked.”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Ay, Sir, it is common in modern practice.
In England it has vainly renewed itself with special frequency
against Bible Societies,&mdash;against the friends of
education,&mdash;against the patrons of vaccination,&mdash;against
the partisans of peace,&mdash;all of whom have been openly
arraigned as provoking and increasing the very evils,
whether of infidelity, ignorance, disease, or war, which
they benignly seek to check. To bring an instance
precisely applicable to our own,&mdash;Wilberforce, when
conducting the Antislavery Enterprise of England, first
against the Slave-Trade, and then against Slavery itself,
was told that those efforts, by which his name is now
consecrated forevermore, tended to increase the hardships
of the slave, even to the extent of riveting anew
his chains. Such are precedents for the imputation to
which our Enterprise is exposed; and such, also, are
precedents by which I exhibit the fallacy of the imputation.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not doubt that the Enterprise produces heat
and irritation, amounting often to inflammation, among
slave-masters, which to superficial minds seems inconsistent
with success, but which the careful observer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
will recognize at once as the natural and not unhealthy
effort of a diseased body to purge itself of existing impurities;
and just in proportion to the malignity of the
concealed poison will be the extent of inflammation.
A distemper like Slavery cannot be ejected like a splinter.
It is too much to expect that men thus tortured
should reason calmly, that patients thus suffering
should comprehend the true nature of their case and
kindly acknowledge the beneficent cure; but not on
this account can it be suspended. Nor, when we consider
the character of Slavery, can it be expected that
men who sustain it will be tranquil. Conscience has
its voice, and will be heard in awful warning hurrying
to and fro in the midnight hour. Its outcry is more
natural than silence.</p>

<p>In the face of this complaint, I assert that the Antislavery
Enterprise has already accomplished incalculable
good. Even now it sweeps the national heart, compelling
it to emotions of transforming power. All are
touched,&mdash;the young, the middle-aged, the old. There
is a new glow at the household hearth. Mothers, wives,
sisters, and daughters are aroused to take part in the
great battle. There is a new aspiration for justice on
earth, awakening not merely a sentiment against Slavery,
such as prevailed with our fathers, but a deep, undying
conviction of its wrong, and a determination to
leave no effort unattempted for its removal. With the
sympathies of all Christendom as allies, already it encompasses
the slave-masters by a <em>moral blockade</em>, invisible
to the eye, but more potent than navies, from which
there can be no escape except in final capitulation. Thus
it has created the irresistible influence which itself constitutes
the beginning of success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>Already are signs of change. In common speech, as
well as in writing, among slave-masters, the bondman is
no longer called <em>slave</em>, but <em>servant</em>,&mdash;thus, by soft substitution,
concealing and condemning the true relation.
Newspapers, even in the land of bondage, blush at the
hunt of men by bloodhounds,&mdash;thus protesting against
an unquestionable incident of Slavery. Other signs appear
in the added comfort of the slave,&mdash;in the enlarged
attention to his wants,&mdash;in the experiments now beginning,
by which the slave is enabled to share in the
profits of his labor, and thus finally secure his freedom,&mdash;and,
above all, in the consciousness among slave-masters
that they dwell now, as never before, under the
keen observation of an ever-wakeful Public Opinion,
quickened by an ever-wakeful Public Press. Nor is
this all. Only lately propositions were introduced into
the Legislatures of different States, and countenanced
by Governors, to mitigate the existing Law of Slavery;
and almost while speaking, I have received drafts of
two different memorials, one to the Legislature of Virginia,
and the other to that of North Carolina, asking
for the slave three things, which it will be monstrous to
refuse, but which, if conceded, will take from Slavery its
existing character: I mean, <em>first</em>, the protection of the
marriage relation; <em>secondly</em>, the protection of the parental
relation; and, <em>thirdly</em>, the privilege of knowledge.
Grant these, and the girdled Upas tree soon must die.
Sir, amidst these tokens of present success, and the auguries
of the future, I am not disturbed by complaints
of seeming damage. “Though it consume our own
dwelling, who does not venerate fire, without which human
life can hardly exist on earth?” says the Hindoo
proverb; and the time is even now at hand, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Antislavery Enterprise, which is the very fire of Freedom,
with all its incidental excesses and excitements,
will be hailed with similar regard.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>It remains to show, in the <em>third</em> place, that the Antislavery
Enterprise, which stands before you at once necessary
and practicable, is commended by inherent <span class="smcap">Dignity</span>.
Here reasons are obvious and unanswerable.</p>

<p>Its object is benevolent; nor is there in the dreary
annals of the Past a single enterprise more clearly and
indisputably entitled to this character. With unsurpassed
and touching magnanimity, it seeks to benefit
the lowly whom your eyes have not seen, and who are
ignorant even of your labors, while it demands and receives
a self-sacrifice calculated to ennoble an enterprise
of even questionable merit. Its true rank is among
works properly called <em>philanthropic</em>,&mdash;the title of highest
honor on earth. “I take goodness in this sense,”
says Lord Bacon in his Essays, “<em>the affecting of the weal
of men</em>, which is that the Grecians call Philanthropia,
&hellip; of all virtues and dignities of the mind the greatest,
being the character of the Deity; and without it, man
is a busy, mischievous, wretched thing, no better than a
kind of vermin.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Lord Bacon was right, and perhaps
unconsciously followed a higher authority; for, when
Moses asked the Lord to show him his glory, the Lord
said, “I will make all my goodness pass before thee.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Ah! Sir, Peace has trophies fairer and more perennial
than any snatched from fields of blood, but, among all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
these, the fairest and most perennial are the trophies of
beneficence. Scholarship, literature, jurisprudence, art,
may wear their well-deserved honors; but an enterprise
of goodness deserves, and will yet receive, a higher palm
than these.</p>

<p>In other aspects its dignity is apparent. It concerns
the cause of Human Freedom, which from earliest days
has been the darling of History. By all the memories
of the Past, by the stories of childhood and the studies
of youth, by every example of magnanimous virtue, by
every aspiration for the good and true, by the fame of
martyrs swelling through all time, by the renown of
patriots whose lives are landmarks of progress, by the
praise lavished upon our fathers, are you summoned to
this work. Unless Freedom be an illusion, and Benevolence
an error, you cannot resist the appeal. Who can
doubt that our cause is nobler even than that of our
fathers? for is it not more exalted to struggle for the
freedom of <em>others</em> than for our <em>own</em>?</p>

<p>Its practical importance at this moment gives to it
additional eminence. Whether measured by the number
of beings it seeks to benefit, by the magnitude of
the wrongs it hopes to relieve, by the difficulties with
which it is beset, by the political relations which it
affects, or by the ability and character it enlists, the
cause of the slave now assumes proportions of grandeur
which dwarf all other interests in our broad country.
In its presence the machinations of politicians, the
aspirations of office-seekers, and the subterfuges of party,
all sink below even their ordinary insignificance. For
myself, Sir, I see among us at this time little else by
which an honest man, wishing to leave the world better
than he found it, can be tempted out upon the exposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
steeps of public life. I see little else which can afford
any of those satisfactions an honest man should covet.
Nor is there any cause so surely promising final success:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Oh! a fair cause stands firm and will abide;</div>
<div class="verse">Legions of angels fight upon her side!”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is written that in the last days there shall be
scoffers, and even this Enterprise, thus philanthropic,
does not escape their aspersions. As the objections to
its Necessity were twofold, and the objections to its
Practicability twofold, so also are the aspersions twofold,&mdash;<em>first</em>,
in the form of hard words, and, <em>secondly</em>,
by personal disparagement of those engaged in it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. The <em>hard words</em> are manifold as the passions and
prejudices of men; but they generally end in the imputation
of “fanaticism.” In such a cause I am willing
to be called “fanatic,” or what you will; I care not for
aspersions, nor shall I shrink before hard words, either
here or elsewhere. They do not hurt. “My dear
Doctor,” said Johnson to Goldsmith, “what harm does
it do any man to call him Holofernes?” From that
great Englishman, Oliver Cromwell, I have learned that
one cannot be trusted “who is afraid of a paper pellet”;
and I am too familiar with history not to know that
every movement for reform, in Church or State, every
endeavor for Human Liberty or Human Rights, has been
thus assailed. I do not forget with what facility and
frequency hard words are employed: how that grandest
character of many generations, the precursor of our
own Washington, without whose example our Republic
might have failed, the great William, Prince of Orange,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
founder of the Dutch Republic, the United States of
Holland,&mdash;I do not forget how he was publicly branded
as “a perjurer and a pest of society”; and, not to dwell
on general instances, how the enterprise for the abolition
of the slave-trade was characterized on the floor of
Parliament, by one eminent speaker as “mischievous,”
and by another as “visionary and delusive”; and how
the exalted characters which it enlisted were arraigned
by still another eminent speaker,&mdash;none other than that
Tarleton, so conspicuous as commander of the British
horse in the Southern campaigns of our Revolution, but
more conspicuous in politics at home,&mdash;“as a junto of
sectaries, sophists, enthusiasts, and fanatics”; and yet
again were arraigned by no less a person than a prince
of the blood, the Duke of Clarence, afterwards William
the Fourth of England, as “either fanatics or hypocrites,”
in one of which categories he openly placed William
Wilberforce.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Impartial History, with immortal pen,
has redressed these impassioned judgments; nor has the
voice of the poet been wanting:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Thy country, Wilberforce, with just disdain,</div>
<div class="verse">Hears thee by cruel men and impious called</div>
<div class="verse">Fanatic, for thy zeal to loose the inthralled</div>
<div class="verse">From exile, public sale, and slavery’s chain.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the same impartial History will yet re-judge the
impassioned judgments of this hour.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>2. Hard words have been followed by <em>personal disparagement</em>,
and the sneer is often raised that our Enterprise
lacks the authority of names eminent in Church
and State. If this be so, the more is the pity on their
account; for our cause is needful to them more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
they are needful to our cause. Alas! it is only according
to example of history that it should be so. It
is not the eminent in Church and State, the rich and
powerful, the favorites of fortune and of place, who most
promptly welcome Truth, when she heralds change in
the existing order of things. It is others in poorer
condition who open hospitable hearts to the unattended
stranger. This is a sad story, beginning with the Saviour,
whose disciples were fishermen, and ending only in our
own day. Each generation has its instances. But the
cause cannot be judged by any such indifference. Strong
in essential truth, it awaits the day, surely at hand, when
all will flock to its support. As the rights of man are
at last recognized, the scoffers, now so heartless, will
forget to scoff.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now, Sir, I present to you the Antislavery Enterprise
vindicated, in Necessity, Practicability, and Dignity,
against all objection. If there be any which I
have not answered, it is because I am not aware of its
existence. It remains that I should give a practical
conclusion to this whole matter, by showing, though in
glimpses only, your <span class="smcap">Special Duties as Freemen of the
North</span>. And, thank God! at last there is a North.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, it is not uncommon to hear persons
among us at the North confess the wrong of Slavery,
and then, folding the hands in absolute listlessness,
ejaculate, “What can we do about it?” Such we
encounter daily. You all know them. Among them
are men in every department of human activity,&mdash;who
perpetually buy, build, and plan,&mdash;who shrink from no
labor,&mdash;who are daunted by no peril of commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
adventure, by no hardihood of industrial enterprise,&mdash;who,
reaching in their undertakings across ocean and
continent, would promise to “put a girdle round about
the earth in forty minutes”; and yet, disheartened, they
can join in no effort against Slavery. Others there are,
especially among the youthful and enthusiastic, who
vainly sigh because they were not born in the age of
Chivalry, or at least in the days of the Revolution, not
thinking that in this Enterprise there is opportunity for
lofty endeavor such as no Paladin of Chivalry or chief
of the Revolution enjoyed. Others there are who freely
bestow means and time upon distant, inaccessible heathen
of another hemisphere, in islands of the sea; and
yet they can do nothing to mitigate our graver heathenism
here at home. While confessing that it ought
to disappear from the earth, they forego, renounce, and
abandon all effort to this end. Others there are still
(such is human inconsistency!) who plant the tree in
whose full-grown shade they can never expect to sit,&mdash;who
hopefully drop the acorn in the earth, trusting
that the oak which it sends upward to the skies will
shelter their children beneath its shade; but they do
nothing to plant or nurture the great tree of Liberty,
that it may shield with its arms unborn generations
of men.</p>

<p>Others still there are, particularly in large cities, who
content themselves with occasional contribution to the
redemption of a slave. To this object they give out of
ample riches, and thus seek to silence the monitions of
conscience. I would not discountenance any activity
by which Human Freedom, even in a single case, may
be secured; but I desire to say that such an act&mdash;too
often accompanied by pharisaical pretension, in contrast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
with the petty performance&mdash;cannot be considered essential
aid to the Antislavery Enterprise. Not in this
way can impression be made on an evil so vast as
Slavery,&mdash;so widely scattered, and so exhaustless in its
unnatural supply. The god Thor, of Scandinavian mythology,
whose power surpassed that of Hercules, was
once challenged to drain dry a simple cup. He applied
it to his lips, and with superhuman capacity drank, but
the water did not recede even from the rim, and at last
the god abandoned the trial. The failure of even his
extraordinary prowess was explained, when he learned
that the cup communicated, by invisible connection,
with the whole vast ocean behind, out of which it was
perpetually supplied, and which remained absolutely
unaffected by the effort. And just so will these occasions
of charity, though encountered by the largest private
means, be constantly renewed; for they communicate
with the whole Black Sea of Slavery behind, out of
which they are perpetually supplied, and which remains
absolutely unaffected by the effort. Sir, private means
may cope with individual necessities, but they are
powerless to redress the evils of a wicked institution.
Charity is limited and local; the evils of Slavery are
infinite and everywhere. Besides, a wrong organized
and upheld by law can be removed only through change
of the law. Not, then, by occasional contribution to
ransom a slave can your duty be done in this great
cause, but only by earnest, constant, valiant effort
against the institution, against the law, which makes
slaves.</p>

<p>I am not insensible to the difficulties of this work.
Full well I know the power of Slavery. Full well I
know all its various intrenchments in the Church, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
politics, and the prejudices of the country. Full well I
know the wakeful interests of property, amounting to
many hundred millions of dollars, which are said to be
at stake. But these things can furnish no motive or
apology for indifference, or any folding of the hands.
Surely the wrong is not less wrong because gigantic;
the evil is not less evil because immeasurable; nor can
the duty of perpetual warfare with wrong and evil be in
this instance suspended. Nay, because Slavery is powerful,
because the Enterprise is difficult, therefore is the
duty of all more exigent. The well-tempered soul does
not yield to difficulties, but presses <em>onward forever</em> with
increased resolution.</p>

<p>But the question recurs, so often pressed in argument,
or in taunt, <em>What have we at the North to do with
Slavery?</em> In answer, I might content myself by saying,
that, as members of the human family, bound together
by cords of common manhood, there is no human wrong
to which we can be insensible, nor is there any human
sorrow which we should not seek to relieve; but I prefer
to say, on this occasion, that, as citizens of the United
States, anxious for the good name, the repose, and the
prosperity of the Republic, that it may be a blessing
and not a curse to mankind, there is nothing among
all its diversified interests, under the National Constitution,
with which, at this moment, we have so much to
do; nor is there anything with regard to which our
duties are so irresistibly clear. I do not dwell on the
scandal of Slavery in the national capital, of Slavery
in the national territories, of the coastwise slave-trade
on the high seas beneath the national flag,&mdash;all of
which are outside State limits, and within the exclusive
jurisdiction of Congress, where you and I, Sir, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
every freeman of the North, are compelled to share the
giant sin and help to bind its chain. To dislodge Slavery
from these usurped footholds, and thus at once relieve
ourselves from grievous responsibility, and begin
the great work of Emancipation, were an object worthy
an exalted ambition. But before even this can be commenced,
there is a great work, more than any other
important and urgent, which must be consummated in
the domain of national politics, and also here at home
in the Free States. The National Government itself
must be emancipated, so that it shall no longer wear
the yoke of servitude; and Slavery in all its pretensions
must be dislodged from a usurped foothold in the Free
States themselves, thus relieving ourselves from serious
responsibility at our own door, and emancipating the
North. Emancipation, even within the national jurisdiction,
can be achieved only through emancipation of
the Free States, accompanied by complete emancipation
of the National Government. Ay, Sir, emancipation at
the South can be reached only through emancipation of
the North. And this is my answer to the interrogatory,
What have we at the North to do with Slavery?</p>

<p>But the answer may be made yet more irresistible,
while, with mingled sorrow and shame, I portray the
tyrannical power which holds us in thraldom. Notwithstanding
all its excess of numbers, wealth, and intelligence,
the North is now the vassal of an OLIGARCHY,
whose single inspiration comes from Slavery. According
to official tables of our recent census, the slave-masters,
all told, are only THREE HUNDRED AND
FORTY-SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED
AND TWENTY-FIVE;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and yet this small company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
now dominates over the Republic, determines its national
policy, disposes of its offices, and sways all to its
absolute will. With a watchfulness that never sleeps
and an activity that never tires, the SLAVE OLIGARCHY
asserts its perpetual and insatiate masterdom,&mdash;now
seizing a broad territory once covered by
a time-honored ordinance of Freedom,&mdash;now threatening
to wrest Cuba from Spain by violent war, or hardly
less violent purchase,&mdash;now hankering for another slice
of Mexico, merely to find new scope for Slavery,&mdash;now
proposing once more to open the hideous, Heaven-defying
Slave-Trade, thus replenishing its shambles with
human flesh,&mdash;and now, by the lips of an eminent
Senator, asserting an audacious claim to the whole
group of the West Indies, whether held by Holland,
Spain, France, or England, as “our Southern islands,”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
while it assails the independence of Hayti, and extends
its treacherous ambition even to the distant valley of
the Amazon.</p>

<p>For all this tyranny there must be tools, and these
are found through a new test for office, where Slavery
is the shibboleth. Nobody, throughout this Republic,
who cannot repeat the hateful word, is taken,&mdash;nobody,
unless faithful to Slavery, is accepted for any
post under the National Government. Yes, let it be
proclaimed, that now at last, not honesty, not capacity,
not fidelity to the Constitution is the test for office,
but unhesitating support of Slavery. This is fidelity,
this is loyalty, according to the new dispensation.
And thus the strength of the whole people is transfused
into this oligarchy. The Constitution, the flag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
itself, and everything we call our own, is degraded to
this wicked rule.</p>

<p>And this giant strength is used with giant heartlessness.
By cruel enactment, which has no source in the
Constitution, which defies justice, tramples on humanity,
and rebels against God, the Free States are made
the hunting-ground for slaves, and you and I and all
good citizens are pressed to join in the loathsome and
abhorred work. Your hearts and judgments, swift to
feel and to condemn, will not require me to expose
here the abomination of the Fugitive Slave Bill, or its
unconstitutionality. Elsewhere I have done this, and
never been answered. Nor will you expect that an enactment
so entirely devoid of all just sanction should be
called by the sacred name of <em>law</em>. History still repeats
the language in which our fathers persevered, when they
denounced the last emanation of British tyranny which
heralded the Revolution, as the Boston Port <em>Bill</em>; and I
am content with this precedent. I have said, that, if any
man finds in the Gospel any support of Slavery, it is because
Slavery is already in himself; so do I now say, if
any man finds in the Constitution of our country any
support of the Fugitive Slave Bill, it is because that bill
is already in himself. One of our ancient masters&mdash;Aristotle,
I think&mdash;tells us that every man has a beast
in his bosom; but the Northern citizen who has the
Fugitive Slave Bill there has worse than a beast,&mdash;a
devil! And yet in this bill, more even than in the
ostracism at which you rebel, does the Slave Oligarchy
stand confessed,&mdash;heartless, grasping, tyrannical,&mdash;careless
of humanity, right, or the Constitution,&mdash;whose
foundation is a coalition of wrong-doers, without even
the semblance of decency,&mdash;while it degrades the Free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
States to the condition of a slave plantation, under the
lash of a vulgar, despised, and revolting overseer.</p>

<p>Surely, fellow-citizens, without hesitation or postponement,
you will insist that this Oligarchy shall be
overthrown; and here is the foremost among the special
duties of the North, now required for the honor of
the Republic, for our own defence, and in obedience to
God.</p>

<p>In urging this comprehensive duty, I ought to have
hours rather than minutes; but in a few words you shall
see its comprehensive importance. With the disappearance
of the Slave Oligarchy, the wickedness of the Fugitive
Slave Bill will drop from the statute-book,&mdash;Slavery
will cease at the national capital,&mdash;Freedom will become
the universal law of the national territory,&mdash;the Slave-Trade
will no longer skulk along our coast beneath the
national flag,&mdash;the Slave-marriage of the nation will be
dissolved,&mdash;the rule of our country will be Freedom instead
of Slavery,&mdash;the North will no longer be trampled
on by the South,&mdash;the North will at last be allowed its
just proportion of office and honor. Let all this be done,
and much more will follow. With the disappearance of
the Slave Oligarchy, you will possess the master-key to
unlock the whole house of bondage. Oh, Sir! prostrate
the Slave Oligarchy, and the gates of Emancipation will
be open at the South.</p>

<p>Without waiting for this consummation, there is another
special duty here at home, on our own soil, which
must be made free in reality, as in name. And here I
shall speak frankly, though not without a proper sense
of the responsibility of my words. I know that I cannot
address you entirely as a private citizen; but I shall say
nothing here which I have not said elsewhere, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
I shall not be proud to vindicate everywhere. “A lie,”
it has been declared, “should be trampled out and extinguished
forever”; and surely you will do nothing less
with a tyrannical and wicked enactment. The Fugitive
Slave Bill, while it continues unrepealed, must be made
a dead letter,&mdash;not by violence, not by any unconstitutional
activity or intervention, not even by hasty conflict
between jurisdictions,&mdash;but by an aroused Public
Opinion, which, in its irresistible might, shall blast with
contempt, indignation, and abhorrence all who consent
to be its agents. Thus did our fathers blast all who
became agents of the Stamp Act; and surely their
motive was small, compared with ours. The Slave-Hunter
who drags his victim from Africa is loathed as a
monster; but I defy any acuteness of reason to indicate
the moral difference between his act and that of the
Slave-Hunter who drags his victim from our Northern
free soil. A few puny persons, calling themselves Congress,
with titles of Representatives and Senators, cannot
turn wrong into right, cannot change a man into
a thing, cannot reverse the irreversible law of God, cannot
make him wicked who hunts a slave on the burning
sands of Congo or Guinea, and make him virtuous
who hunts a slave over the pavements of Boston or
New York. Nor can any acuteness of reason distinguish
between the original bill of sale from the kidnapper,
by which the unhappy African was transferred in
Congo or Guinea, and the certificate of the Commissioner,
by which, when once again in Freedom, he is
reduced anew to bondage. The acts are kindred, and
should share a kindred condemnation.</p>

<p>One man’s virtue becomes a standard of excellence for
all; and there is now in Boston a simple citizen whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
example may be a lesson to Commissioners, Marshals,
Magistrates, while it fills all with the beauty of a generous
act. I refer to Mr. Hayes, who resigned his place
in the city police rather than take part in the pack of
the Slave-Hunter. He is now the door-keeper of the
public edifice honored this winter by the triumphant
lectures on Slavery. Better be a door-keeper in the
house of the Lord than a dweller in the tents of the
ungodly. Has he not chosen well? Little think those
now doing the work of Slavery that the time is near
when all this will be dishonor and sadness. For myself,
long ago my mind was made up. Nothing will I have
to do with it. How can I help to make a slave? The
idea alone is painful. To do this thing would plant in
my soul a remorse which no time could remove or mitigate.
His chains would clank in my ears. His cries
would strike upon my heart. His voice would be my
terrible accuser. Mr. President, may no such voice fall
on your soul or mine!</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, here our duty is plain and paramount. While
the Slave Oligarchy, through its unrepealed Slave Bill,
undertakes to enslave our free soil, we can only turn for
protection to a Public Opinion worthy of a humane,
just, and religious people, which shall keep perpetual
guard over the liberties of all within our borders. On
this from the beginning I have relied. On this I now
rely. Wherever it is already strong, I would keep it so;
wherever it is weak, I would strengthen it, until of itself
it is an all-sufficient protection, with watch and ward
surrounding the fugitive, surrounding all. And this
Public Opinion, with Freedom as its countersign, must
proclaim not only the overthrow of the Slave Bill, but
also the overthrow of the Slave Oligarchy behind,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
two pressing duties of the North, essential to our
own emancipation; and believe me, Sir, while they remain
undone, nothing is done.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, far already have I trespassed upon
your generous patience; but there are other things
pressing for utterance. Something would I say of the
arguments by which our Enterprise is commended;
something also of the appeal it makes to people of every
condition; and something, too, of union, as a vital
necessity, among all who love Freedom.</p>

<p>I know not if our work will be soon accomplished.
I know not, Sir, if you or I shall live to see in our Republic
the vows of the Fathers at length fulfilled, as the
last fetter falls from the last slave. But one thing I do
know, beyond all doubt or question: that this Enterprise
must go on; that, in its irresistible current, it will
sweep schools, colleges, churches, the intelligence, the
conscience, and the religious aspiration of the land, while
all who stand in its way or speak evil of it are laying
up sorrow and shame for their children, if not for themselves.
Better strive in this cause, even unsuccessfully,
than never strive at all. The penalty of indifference is
akin to the penalty of opposition,&mdash;as is well pictured
by the great Italian poet, when, among the saddest on
the banks of Acheron, rending the air with outcries of
torment, shrieks of anger, and smiting of hands, he finds
the troop of dreary souls who had been ciphers in the
great conflicts of life:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Mingled with whom, of their disgrace the proof,</div>
<div class="verse">Are the vile angels, who did not rebel,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>
<p>There is no weapon in the celestial armory of Truth,
no sweet influence from the skies, no generous word
from human lips, which may not be employed. Ours,
too, is the argument alike of the Conservative and the
Reformer; for our cause stands on the truest conservatism
and the truest reform. It seeks the conservation
of Freedom itself, and of kindred historic principles; it
seeks also the reform of Slavery, and of the kindred tyranny
by which it is upheld. Religion, morals, justice,
economy, the Constitution, each and all, may be invoked;
and one person is touched by one argument, while another
person is touched by another. You do not forget
how Christopher Columbus won Isabella of Spain to
his enterprise of discovery. He began with the temptation
of extending her dominions; but she hearkened not.
Next he promised the dazzling wealth of the Indies; and
still she hearkened not. When, at last, to her pious
imagination were pictured poor heathen with souls to be
saved, then the youthful Queen poured her royal jewels
into the lap of the Genoese adventurer, and at her expense
went forth that small fleet which gave to Spain
and to mankind a New World.</p>

<p>As in this Enterprise there is a place for every argument,
so also is there a place for every man. Even as
on the broad shield of Achilles, sculptured by divine art,
was wrought every form of human activity, so in this
cause, which is the very shield of Freedom, whatever
man can do by deed or speech will find its place. One
may act in one way, and another in another way; but all
must act. Providence is felt through individuals; the
dropping of water wears away the rock; and no man can
be too humble or poor for this work, while to all the
happy in genius, fortune, or fame it makes a special appeal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>Here is room for the strength of Luther and the
sweetness of Melancthon, for the wisdom of age and the
ardor of youth, for the judgment of the statesman and
the eloquence of the orator, for the grace of the scholar
and the aspiration of the poet, for the learning of the
professor and the skill of the lawyer, for the exhortation
of the preacher and the persuasion of the press, for the
various energy of man and the abounding sympathy of
woman.</p>

<p>And still one thing more is needed, without which
Liberty-loving men, and their arguments, will fail in
power,&mdash;even as without charity all graces of knowledge,
speech, and faith are said to profit nothing. I mean
that <em>Unity of Spirit</em>&mdash;in itself a fountain of strength&mdash;which,
filling the people of the North, shall make them
tread under foot past antipathies, decayed dissensions,
and those irritating names which now exist only as tattered
ensigns of ancient strife. It is right to be taught by
the enemy; and with their example before us, and their
power brandished in our very faces, we cannot hesitate.
With them Slavery is the mainspring of political life,
and the absorbing centre of political activity; with them
all differences are swallowed up by this <em>one idea</em>, as all
other rods were swallowed up by the rod of Aaron; with
them all unite to keep the National Government under
the control of slave-masters: and surely we should not
do less for Freedom than they do for Slavery. <em>We, too,
must be united.</em> Among us at last mutual criticism, crimination,
and feud must give place to mutual sympathy,
trust, and alliance. Face to face against the Slave Oligarchy
must be rallied the UNITED MASSES of the
North, in compact political association,&mdash;planted on the
everlasting base of justice,&mdash;knit together by instincts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
of a common danger and holy sympathies of humanity,&mdash;enkindled
by love of Freedom, not only for themselves,
but for others,&mdash;determined to enfranchise the
National Government from degrading thraldom,&mdash;and
constituting the BACKBONE PARTY, powerful in
numbers, wealth, and intelligence, but more powerful
still in an inspiring cause. Let this be done, and victory
will be ours.</p>

<h2><a name="NEW_OUTRAGE_FOR_THE_SAKE_OF_SLAVERY" id="NEW_OUTRAGE_FOR_THE_SAKE_OF_SLAVERY"></a>NEW OUTRAGE FOR THE SAKE OF SLAVERY.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Letter to Passmore Williamson, in Moyamensing Prison,
August 11, 1855.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner occupied several weeks of this summer in a tour
to the West, ascending the Mississippi to St. Paul, and then, from
Detroit, visiting Lake Superior. While on board a steamer in Lake
Superior, he learned by the newspapers that Passmore Williamson, an
excellent citizen of Philadelphia, had been flung into prison for the
offence of reminding a person claimed as slave, that, being brought to
Philadelphia voluntarily by her pretended master, she was free, according
to well-known principles of jurisprudence. The indignation of
Mr. Sumner found expression in the following letter, which he addressed
to the new victim of Slavery.</p>

<p>This remarkable case will be found in a volume published at Philadelphia,
in 1856, with the following title: “Case of Passmore Williamson.
Report of the Proceedings on the Writ of Habeas Corpus issued
by the Hon. John K. Kane, Judge of the District Court of the United
States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in the Case of the
United States of America <i>ex rel.</i> John H. Wheeler <i>vs.</i> Passmore Williamson,
including the several Opinions delivered, and the Arguments of
Counsel, reported by Arthur Cannon, Esq., Phonographer.” From
this it appears that John H. Wheeler, of Virginia, in a petition to
Hon. John K. Kane, Judge of the District Court of the United States
for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, dated July 18, 1855, sets forth,
that he is “the owner of three persons held to service or labor by the
laws of the State of Virginia, said persons being respectively named
Jane, aged about thirty-five years, Daniel, aged about twelve years,
and Isaiah, aged about seven years, persons of color, and that they
are detained from the possession of your petitioner by one Passmore
Williamson, resident of the city of Philadelphia, and that they are not
detained for any criminal or supposed criminal matter,” and asks a writ
of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> commanding Mr. Williamson to bring before the
Judge the bodies of the said Jane, Daniel, and Isaiah. The writ was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>at once allowed, and the next day followed by another, to which Mr.
Williamson made return, that “the within named Jane, Daniel, and
Isaiah, or by whatsoever names they may be called, nor either of
them, are not now, nor was at the time of the issuing of said writ or
the original writ, or at any other time, in the custody, power, or possession
of, nor confined nor restrained their liberty by him, the said
Passmore Williamson. Therefore he cannot have the bodies of the
said Jane, Daniel, and Isaiah, or either of them, before your Honor, as
by the said writ he is commanded.”</p>

<p>In the course of the proceedings, Mr. Williamson, who was Secretary
to the Acting Committee of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, testified
as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I was informed that three slaves were at Bloodgood’s Hotel, who wished
to assert their right to freedom; I went to the hotel, and saw a yellow boy
on the steps fronting on Walnut Street; I made inquiry of him, and he
stated that such was the case, but referred me up stairs to one of the waiters
for further information; the latter informed me that the slaves, with their
master, had just gone on board the steamboat at the end of Walnut Street
wharf, for the purpose of going to New York in the five o’clock line. I went
on board the boat, looked through the cabin, and then went up on the
promenade deck; I saw that man” (<i>pointing to Mr. Wheeler</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span> “sitting sideways
on the bench on the farther side; Jane was sitting next to and three
or four feet from him; the two children were sitting close to her. I approached
her and said, ‘You are the person I am looking for, I presume’;
Wheeler turned towards me and asked what I wanted with him; I replied,
Nothing, that my business was entirely with this woman; he said, ‘She is my
slave, and anything you have to say to her you can say to me.’ <em>I then said
to her, ‘You may have been his slave, but you are now free; he brought you here
into Pennsylvania, and you are now as free as either of us; you cannot be compelled
to go with him, unless you choose; if you wish your liberty, all you have
to do is to walk ashore with your children.’</em> Some five minutes were consumed
in conversation with Wheeler, Jane, and a stranger, when the bell rang,
and I told her, if she wished to be free, she would have to act at once, as the
boat was about starting. She took one of her children by the hand and
attempted to rise from her seat; Wheeler placed his hands upon her shoulders
and prevented her; I then, for the first time, took hold of her arm and
assisted her to rise; the colored people who had collected around us seized
hold of the two children, and the whole party commenced a movement towards
the head of the stairs leading to the lower deck, Mr. Wheeler having at the
start clinched Jane, and during the progress repeatedly and earnestly entreated
her to say she wished to stay with him; at the head of the stairway
I took Wheeler by the collar and held him to one side. The whole company
passed down and left the boat, proceeding peacefully and quietly to Dock
and Front Streets, where Jane and her children, with some of her friends,
entered a carriage and were driven down Front Street; I returned to my
office. <em>After the colored people left Dock Street in the carriage, I saw no
more of them, have had no control of them, and do not know where they are.
My whole connection with the affair was this.</em>”</p>

</div>

<p>At the conclusion of Mr. Williamson’s cross-examination, he declared
to the Court “that in the proceedings he had not designed to do violence
to any law, but supposed that he had acted throughout in accordance
with the law, and the legal rights of the respective parties.”</p>

<p>On his return to the writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i>, Mr. Williamson was held
to bail in the sum of $5,000 for perjury, and subsequently committed,
without bail, for contempt,&mdash;the alleged contempt being the declaration
that the parties were never in his custody. In the course of the
hearing, the Judge remarked that “the conduct of those who interfered
with Mr. Wheeler’s rights was a criminal, wanton, and cruel outrage.”
His final decree, July 27, 1855, was as follows: “Let Mr.
Williamson, the respondent, be committed to the custody of the marshal
without bail or mainprise, as for a contempt of the Court in refusing
to answer to the writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i>, heretofore awarded against
him at the relation of Mr. Wheeler.” On the motion looking to a
committal for perjury the Judge “withheld an expression of opinion,”
observing, that, “Mr. Williamson being under arrest, he may be charged
at any time by the grand jury.”</p>

<p>The respondent attempted to regain his freedom by an application to
the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. After solemn hearing, the application
was refused, the Hon. J. S. Black, afterwards a member of
President Buchanan’s cabinet, giving the opinion of the Court. The
State Court was in obvious sympathy with the National Court, and both
were sympathetic with Slavery. Meanwhile Mr. Williamson continued
a prisoner, until, at last, November 3, 1855, his case was again presented
to the Judge who committed him, when, in reply to formal interrogatories,
he declared: “I did not seek to obey the writ by producing the
persons therein mentioned before the Court, because I had not, at the
time of the service of the writ, the power over, the custody, or control
of them, and therefore it was impossible for me to do so.&hellip; I sought
to obey the writ by answering it truly; the parties not being in my
possession or control, it was impossible for me to obey the writ by producing
them.” The Judge announced the contempt purged and the
party released from custody.</p>

<p>While the immediate object of this proceeding was to compel Mr.
Williamson to produce the bodies of Jane, Daniel, and Isaiah, claimed
as slaves in Philadelphia by a person who had voluntarily brought them
there, it is impossible to explain the action of the Judge except by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>desire to establish the protection of the National Government over
slave-masters travelling with their slaves in Free States. The claimant,
at the discharge of Mr. Williamson, stated by his counsel that he
“sought an adjudication, by the highest judicial tribunal of the country,
of the questions, whether Mr. Wheeler was entitled to pass over the
soil of Pennsylvania with his property? and whether or not a wrong
had been committed in the forcible abduction thereof?”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Williamson was in the Moyamensing Prison from July 27th to
November 3, 1855.</p>

</div>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Lake Superior, On Board the North Star</span>,<br />
Saturday, August 11, 1855.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;With astonishment and indignation
I have learned the story of your imprisonment;
and now, from this distant retreat, where I
am for the moment, make haste to send you my sympathy.</p>

<p>From beginning to end, from side to side, and in
every aspect, this transaction can be regarded only as
a clear, indubitable, and utterly unmitigated outrage.
The new-fangled doctrine, that a slave-master can <em>voluntarily</em>
import his alleged slave&mdash;of course with all the
revolting incidents of Slavery&mdash;into the Free States,
is not more odious than preposterous. It is scouted
by reason, and disowned by universal jurisprudence.
You were right in disregarding it. In stepping forward
to remind persons claimed as slaves on this pretext
that all such claim is baseless, you did a good
work. It was this knowledge which filled them with
confidence to regain their God-given liberty. And for
this it appears that you have been brought before a
man, “dressed in a little brief authority,” who has cast
you into prison.</p>

<p>This outrage is rendered more outrageous by the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
in which it was done. It was perpetrated through perversion
of the great writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i>. This writ
of freedom and deliverance, which in England is often
styled the Palladium of the Constitution, which is recognized
as a distinctive feature of Constitutional Government,
which finds no place in despotism, and which is
the very master-key appointed to unlock prison-doors
and let the oppressed go free, has been made in your
case, by a hocus-pocus without precedent, the instrument
of imprisonment and oppression.</p>

<p>Strange and disgraceful as all this is, it must be considered
the natural fruit of Slavery. Any person, whosoever
he may be, whether simple citizen or magistrate,
who undertakes to uphold this wrong, seems
forthwith to lose his reason. He may be just, humane,
and decent in other things, but in the support of Slavery
he becomes unjust, inhuman, and indecent,&mdash;often in
obvious unconsciousness of his degradation. The blindness
which makes him insensible to wrong so transcendent
naturally makes him insensible to the lesser wrong
by which it is maintained. What is the writ of <i>Habeas
Corpus</i>, the trial by jury, the privilege of debate, or your
liberty or mine, in the estimation of a person who has
already screwed himself to the pitch of injustice necessary
for the vindication of an institution which separates
parent and child, which stamps woman as a concubine,
which shuts the gates of knowledge, and which
snatches from the weak all the hard-earned fruits of
incessant toil?</p>

<p>But there must be an end to these things; and as
Shakespeare found a jewel in the toad’s head, so do I
find a cheering omen even in the injustice which has
made you its victim. There is an old saying, handed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
down from distant antiquity, that “whoso the gods wish
to destroy they first make mad”; and I have often of
late been impressed by its truth. The Slave Oligarchy
is mad, and their overflowing madness runs through
every agent and tool. In all that they do&mdash;especially
in the Fugitive Slave Bill and its cruel enforcement,
the Nebraska Bill and its felonious administration, and
now in the imprisonment of an unoffending citizen&mdash;I
rejoice to believe that there is unmistakable evidence
of that madness which precedes a fall. Verily the
day is at hand when returning justice will once more
bear sway; then, among the triumphs of Freedom, will
be a reckoning with unjust judges.</p>

<p>Meanwhile accept my congratulations on the portion
of responsibility and dignity which is yours. It is a
privilege to suffer for truth; and I envy not the meanness
of that soul which would hesitate to prefer your
place within the stone walls of a prison to the cushioned
bench of the magistrate by whose irrational and
tyrannical edict you have been condemned.</p>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, 26th September, 1855.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;Constrained by other things, I
renounce with much reluctance the opportunity
which you offer me of partaking in the splendid hospitality
prepared by the Publishers for the Authors of our
country.</p>

<p>The occasion will be of special interest. It would be
pleasant to sit at feast with so many, who, as Authors,
adorn our national name. And it would be pleasant
also to be the guest of those active, enlightened, and
generous Publishers who do so much for Authors. But
I must forego this luxury. Only in “bare imagination”
can I enjoy it.</p>

<p>At your table there will be an aggregation of various
genius and talent constituting a true <i>Witenagemote</i>,
which may justly gratify an honest pride of country.
Grateful as this may be as a token of power, it will be
more grateful still as a token of that concord growing
among men in all the relations of life. The traditional
feud between Authors and Publishers promises to lose
itself in your Festival, even as the traditional feud between
England and France is absorbed in the welcome
of Victoria by Louis Napoleon. This is beautiful. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
the whole scene, where differing Authors commingle under
auspices of differing Publishers, will be an augury
of that permanent coöperation and harmony which will
secure to the pen its mightiest triumphs.</p>

<p>It is in honor of the pen that the company will be
gathered together. If any word of mine be expected,
please let me offer the following sentiment.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>The Pen of the Author</i>,&mdash;Exposing error, defending truth,
instructing the ignorant, cheering the unhappy, while charming
and animating <em>all</em>, it can do better than the Sword, and
will yet receive from the world a higher praise.</p>

<p>In my heart I have already ratified those nominations.
On some other occasion I hope for an opportunity

expression of the existing state of things, it is so
clearly the offspring of the aroused conscience of the

<h2><a name="POLITICAL_PARTIES_AND_OUR_FOREIGN-BORN" id="POLITICAL_PARTIES_AND_OUR_FOREIGN-BORN"></a>POLITICAL PARTIES AND OUR FOREIGN-BORN
POPULATION.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Speech at a Republican Rally in Faneuil Hall,
November 2, 1855.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Immediately before the election there was a Republican Rally at
Faneuil Hall, with the following officers: Richard H. Dana, Jr., Esq.,
<i>President</i>; Dr. Edward Reynolds, Ezra Lincoln, William Pope, Josiah
W. Butler, Aaron Bancroft, Samuel Johnson, James P. Whitney,
Prince Hawes, Daniel Kimball, Charles M. Ellis, N. Davies Cotton, Frederick
A. Sumner, John G. Webster, George S. Winslow, Henry W.
Farley, of East Boston, William P. Houston, of South Boston, Henry
Slade, of Chelsea, Francis B. Fay, of Chelsea, and James L. Jones, of
Chelsea, <i>Vice-Presidents</i>; John D. W. Joy, E. Baker Welch, Franklin
W. Smith, Samuel W. Lane, <i>Secretaries</i>.</p>

<p>On taking the chair, Mr. Dana made an able speech especially in
reply to one recently made by Mr. Choate, in the course of which he
said that the Republicans repudiated the charge of ignoring the Constitution
or menacing the Union.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner was then introduced, and spoke for two hours and a
quarter, with the marked attention of a very large audience. This
speech was reported at length in the papers, and was afterwards printed
in a pamphlet. It particularly discussed the Slave Oligarchy and
its usurpations,&mdash;the outrages in Kansas,&mdash;the different political parties,&mdash;the
rights of our foreign-born population,&mdash;and the Republican
party. Several of these topics, being treated in other speeches, are
omitted here. The part relating to our foreign-born population attracted
attention at the time, and has been often quoted since. Among the
audience were many persons of the Know-Nothing party, pledged
against the foreign-born, who were there to create difficulty; but Mr.
Sumner was allowed to proceed uninterrupted. The papers speak of
“rapturous applause.” In this vindication of our foreign-born population,
he acted only according to his convictions and all his votes in
the Senate. Although the Know-Nothing party prevailed in Massachusetts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Mr. Sumner refused all association with it; and yet, such
was the recklessness of misrepresentation, that the Richmond <i>Enquirer</i>
announced him as “the head of the Northern Know-Nothing party.”
The following speech is sufficient answer to this assertion.</p>

<p>In the course of this speech Mr. Sumner gives his personal testimony
as to Slavery, founded on what he saw in a short journey he had made
through Kentucky as far as Nashville in Tennessee.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Fellow-citizens of Boston</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">Are you for Freedom, or are you for Slavery? This
is the question which you are to answer at the
coming election. Above all other questions, national or
local, it lifts itself directly in the path of every voter.
There it is. It cannot be avoided. It cannot be banished
away. It cannot be silenced. Forever sounding
in our ears, it has a mood for every hour,&mdash;stirring us
at times as with the blast of a trumpet, then visiting us
in solemn tones, like the bell which calls to prayer, and
then again awaking us to unmistakable duty, like the
same bell, when at midnight it summons all to stay the
raging conflagration.</p>

<p>And yet there are persons among us who seek to put
this great question aside. Some clamor for financial reform,
and hold up a tax-bill; others clamor for a modification
of the elective franchise, and they hold up the
Pope; some speak in the name of old parties, calling
themselves Democrats or Whigs; others in the name of
a new party, which shall be nameless at present. Surely
the people of Massachusetts will not be diverted from
the true issue, involving Freedom for broad territories
and Freedom for themselves, by holding up a tax-bill
or by holding up the Pope. The people of Massachusetts
are intelligent and humane.</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>But above all these is heard the great question, which
will not be postponed, Are you for Freedom, or are you
for Slavery? “Under which king, Bezonian? Speak or
die!” Are you for Freedom, with its priceless blessings,
or are you for Slavery, with its countless wrongs and
woes? Are you for God, or are you for the Devil?</p>

<p>Fellow-Citizens, I speak plainly; nor can words exhibiting
the enormity of Slavery be too plain, whether it be
regarded simply in the legislative and judicial decisions
by which it is upheld, or in the unquestionable facts by
which its character is revealed. It has been my fortune
latterly to see Slavery face to face in its own home, in
the Slave States; and I take this early opportunity to
offer my testimony to the open barbarism which it sanctions.
I have seen a human being knocked off at auction
on the steps of a court-house, and, as the sale went on,
compelled to open his mouth and show his teeth, like a
horse; I have been detained in a stage-coach, that our
driver might, in the phrase of the country, “help lick a
nigger”; and I have been constrained, at public table, to
witness the revolting spectacle of a poor slave, yet a child,
almost felled to the floor by a blow on the head from a
clenched fist. Such incidents were not calculated to
shake my original convictions. The distant slaveholder,
who, in generous solicitude for that truth which makes
for Freedom, feared, that, like a certain Doctor of Divinity,
I might, under influence of personal kindness, be
hastily swayed from these convictions, may be assured
that I saw nothing to change them one tittle, but much to
confirm them,&mdash;while I was entirely satisfied that here in
Massachusetts, where all read, the true character of Slavery
is better known than in the Slave States themselves,
where ignorance and prejudice close the avenues of
knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>And now, grateful for the attention with which you
honor me, I venture to hope that you are assembled honestly
to hear the truth,&mdash;not to gratify prejudice, to appease
personal antipathies, or to indulge a morbid appetite
for excitement, but with candor and your best discrimination
to weigh facts and arguments in order to
determine the course of duty. I address myself particularly
to the friends of Freedom, Republicans, on
whose invitation I appear to-night; but I make bold to
ask you of other parties, who now listen, to divest yourselves,
for the time, of partisan constraint,&mdash;to forget,
for the moment, that you are Whigs or Democrats, or
however called, and to remember only that you are <em>men</em>,
with hearts to feel, with heads to understand, and with
consciences to guide. Then only will you be in condition
to receive the truth. “If men are not aware of the probable
influence of party over them, they are so much the
more likely to be blindly governed by it.” Such is the
wise remark of Wilberforce.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> And I fear that among us
there are too many unconsciously governed by such bias.
There are men, who, while professing candor, yet show
that the bitterness of party has entered into their whole
character and lives, as the bitterness of the soil in Sardinia
is said to appear even in its honey.</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<p>There are honorable responsibilities belonging to
Massachusetts, as an early and constant vindicator of
Freedom, which she cannot renounce. “If the trumpet
give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to
the battle?” The distant emigrant, the whole country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
awaits the voice of our beloved Commonwealth
in answer to the question, Are you for Freedom, or
are you for Slavery? So transcendent, so exclusive, so
all-absorbing at the present juncture is this question,
that it is vain to speak of the position of candidates on
other things. To be doubtful on this is to be wrong,
and to be wrong on this is to be wholly wrong. Passing
strange it is that here in Massachusetts, in this
nineteenth century, we should be constrained to put this
question; passing strange, that, when it is put, there
should be any hesitation to answer it, by voice and vote,
in such way as to speak the loudest for Freedom.</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<p>But, without exposing the game of political sweepstakes
which the Slave Oligarchy has perpetually played,&mdash;interesting
as it would be,&mdash;I prefer to hold up for
one moment the assumptions, aggressions, and usurpations
by which, in defiance of the Constitution, it has
made Slavery national, when it is in reality sectional.
Here is a brief catalogue.</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens, I have said enough to stir you; but
this humiliating tale is not yet finished. An oligarchy
seeking to maintain an outrage like Slavery, and drawing
its inspirations from this fountain of wickedness, is
naturally base, false, and heedless of justice. It is vain
to expect that men who have brought themselves to become
propagandists of this enormity will be constrained
by any compromise, compact, bargain, or plighted faith.
As the less is contained in the greater, so there is no
vileness of dishonesty, no denial of human rights, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
is not plainly involved in the support of an enormity
which begins by changing man, created in the image
of God, into a chattel, and consigns little children to
the auction-block. A power which Heaven never gave
can be maintained only by means which Heaven can
never sanction. And this conclusion of reason is confirmed
by late experience.</p>

<p>And here I approach the special question under
which the country now shakes from side to side. The
protracted struggle of 1820, known as the Missouri
Question, ended with the admission of Missouri as a
slaveholding State, and the prohibition of Slavery in
all the remaining territory west of the Mississippi
and north of 36° 30´. Here was a solemn act of legislation,
called at the time a compromise, a covenant, a
compact, first brought forward by the Slave Oligarchy,
vindicated by it in debate, finally sanctioned by its
votes,&mdash;also upheld at the time by a slaveholding
President, James Monroe, and his cabinet, of whom a
majority were slaveholders, including Mr. Calhoun himself,&mdash;and
made the condition of the admission of Missouri,
without which that State could not have been
received into the Union. Suddenly, during the last
year, without any notice in the public press or the
prayer of a single petition, after an acquiescence of
thirty-four years, and the irreclaimable possession by
the Slave Oligarchy of its special share in the provisions
of this Compromise, in violation of every obligation
of honor, compact, and good neighborhood, and
in contemptuous disregard of the outgushing sentiments
of an aroused North, this time-honored Prohibition,
in itself a Landmark of Freedom, was overturned,
and the vast region now known as Kansas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
and Nebraska was opened to Slavery: and this was
done under the disgraceful lead of Northern politicians,
and with the undisguised complicity of a Northern
President, forgetful of Freedom, forgetful also of his
reiterated pledges that during his administration the
repose of the country should receive no shock.</p>

<p>And all this was perpetrated under pretences of popular
rights. Freedom was betrayed by a kiss. In defiance
of uninterrupted prescription down to our day,
early sustained at the South as well as the North,
leaning at once on Jefferson and Washington, sanctioned
by all the authoritative names of our history, and
beginning with the great Ordinance by which Slavery
was prohibited in the Northwest,&mdash;it was pretended
that the people of the United States, who are the proprietors
of the national domain, and who, according to
the Constitution, may “make all needful rules and regulations”
for its government, nevertheless were not its
sovereigns, that they had no power to interdict Slavery
there, but that this eminent dominion resided in the
few settlers, called squatters, whom chance or a desire to
better their fortunes first hurried into these places. To
this precarious handful, sprinkled over immense spaces,
it was left, without any constraint from Congress, to decide
whether into these vast unsettled lands, as into the
veins of an infant, should be poured the festering poison
of Slavery, destined, as time advances, to show itself in
cancers and leprous disease, or whether they should be
filled with all the glowing life of Freedom. And this
great power, transferred from Congress to these few settlers,
was hailed by the new-fangled name of <em>Squatter
Sovereignty</em>.</p>

<p>It was fit that the original outrage perpetrated under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
such pretences should be followed by other outrages
perpetrated in defiance of these pretences. In the race
of emigration the Freedom-loving citizens of the North
promised to obtain the ascendency, and, in the exercise
of the conceded sovereignty of the settlers, to prohibit
Slavery. The Slave Oligarchy was aroused to other
efforts. Of course it stuck at nothing. On the day of
election, when this vaunted popular sovereignty was first
invoked, hirelings from Missouri, having no home in the
Territory, entered it in bands of fifties and hundreds, and,
assuming an electoral franchise to which they had no
claim, trampled under foot the Constitution and laws.
Violently, ruthlessly, the polls were possessed by these
invaders. The same Northern President, who did not
shrink from unblushing complicity in the original outrage,
now assumed another complicity. Though prompt
to lavish the Treasury, the Army, and the Navy of the
Republic in hunting a single slave through the streets
of Boston, he could see the Constitution and laws which
he was sworn to protect, and those popular rights which
he had affected to promote, all struck down in Kansas,&mdash;and
then give new scope to these invaders by the
removal of the faithful Governor, who had become obnoxious
to the Slave Oligarchy because he would not
become its tool, and the substitution of another, who
vindicated the dishonest choice by making haste, on
his first arrival there, to embrace the partisans of
Slavery. The Legislature, which was constituted by
the overthrow of the electoral franchise, proceeded to
overthrow every safeguard of Freedom. At one swoop
it adopted all the legislation of Missouri, including its
Slave Code; by another act it imposed unprecedented
conditions upon the exercise of the electoral franchise;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
and by still another act it denounced <em>the punishment
of death</em> no less than five times against as many different
forms of interference with the alleged property
in human flesh, while all who but write or speak against
Slavery are adjudged to be felons. Yes, fellow-citizens,
should any person there presume to print or circulate
the speech in which I now express my abhorrence of
Slavery, and deny its constitutional existence anywhere
within the national jurisdiction, he would become liable
under this act as a felon. And this overthrow of all
popular rights is done in the name of Popular Sovereignty.
Surely its authors follow well the example
of the earliest Squatter Sovereign,&mdash;none other than
Satan,&mdash;who, stealing into Eden, was there discovered
by the celestial messengers just beginning his work: as
Milton tells us,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent6">“Him there they found</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Squat</em> like a toad, close at the ear of Eve.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Would you know the secret of this unprecedented
endeavor, beginning with the repeal of the Prohibition
of Slavery, down to the latest atrocity? The answer is
at hand. It is not merely to provide new markets for
slaves, or even to guard Slavery in Missouri, but to
build another Slave State, and thus, by the presence of
two additional Slaveholding Senators, to give increased
preponderance to the Slave Oligarchy in the National
Government. As men are murdered for the sake of
their money, so is this Territory blasted in peace and
prosperity in order to wrest its political influence to
the side of Slavery.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But a single usurpation is not enough to employ the
rapacious energies of our Oligarchy. At this moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
while the country is pained by the heartless conspiracy
against Freedom in Kansas, we are startled by another
effort, which contemplates not merely the political subjugation
of the National Government, but the actual introduction
of Slavery into the Free States. The vaunt
is made that slaves will yet be counted in the shadow
of the monument on Bunker Hill, and more than one
step has been taken towards this effrontery. A person
of Virginia has asserted his right to hold slaves in New
York on the way to Texas; and this claim is still pending
before the highest judicial tribunal of the land. A
similar claim has been asserted in Pennsylvania, and
thus far been sustained by the court. A blameless citizen,
who, in obedience to generous impulses, and in
harmony with received law, merely gave notice to a
person held as a slave in a Free State that she was in
reality free, has been thrust into jail, and now, after
the lapse of months, still languishes there, the victim of
this pretension; while&mdash;that no excess might be wanting
in the madness of this tyranny&mdash;the great writ of
Habeas Corpus, proudly known as the writ of deliverance,
has been made the instrument of his imprisonment.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
Outrage treads upon outrage, and great rights
pass away to perish. Alas! the needful tool for such
work is too easily found in places low and high,&mdash;in the
lanes and cellars of Boston, on the bench of the judge,
in the chair of the President. But it is the power behind
which I impeach. The Slave Oligarchy does it; the
Slave Oligarchy does it all.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To the prostration of this Oligarchy we are bound
by a threefold cord of duty: <em>first</em>, as we would secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Freedom for ourselves; <em>secondly</em>, as we would uphold
Freedom in distant Kansas; and, <em>thirdly</em>, as we would
preserve the Union in its early strength and integrity.
The people of Kansas are, many of them, from Massachusetts,&mdash;bone
of our bone, flesh of our flesh; but as
fellow-citizens under the Constitution they are bound
to us by ties which we cannot disown; nay, more,&mdash;by
the subtile cord which connects this embryo settlement
with the Republic, they are made part of us. The
outrage which touches them touches us. What galls
them galls us. The fetter which binds the slave in
Kansas binds every citizen in Massachusetts. Thus are
we prompted to their rescue, not only to save them, but
also to save ourselves. The tyranny which now treads
them down has already trampled on us, and only awaits
an opportunity to do it again. In its complete overthrow
is the only way of safety. Indeed, this must be
done before anything else can be done.</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<p>In the choice of men we are driven to the organization
of parties; and here occurs the practical question
on which hinges immediate duty,&mdash;By what political
party can our desire be accomplished? There are individuals
in all parties, even the Democratic, who hate
Slavery, and say so; but a political party cannot be
judged by the private opinions of some of its members.
Something else, more solid and tangible, must
appear. The party that we select to bear the burden
and honor of our great controversy should be adapted
to the work. It must be a perfect machine. Wedded
to Freedom for better or for worse, and clinging to it
with a grasp never to be unloosed, it must be clear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
open, and unequivocal in its declarations, and should
admit no other question to divert its energies. It must
be all for Freedom, and, like Cæsar’s wife, above suspicion.
But besides this character which it should
sustain in Massachusetts, it must be prepared to take
its place in close phalanx with the united masses of
the North, now organizing through all the Free States,
<i>junctæque umbone phalanges</i>, for the protection of Freedom
and the overthrow of the Slave Oligarchy.</p>

<p>Bearing these conditions in mind, there are three parties
which we may dismiss, one by one, as they pass in
review. Men do not gather grapes from thorns, nor figs
from thistles; nor do they expect patriotism from Benedict
Arnold. A party which sustains the tyrannies and
perfidies of the Slave Oligarchy, and is represented by
the President, through whom has come so much of all
our woe, need not occupy our time; and such is the
Democratic party. If there be within the sound of my
voice a single person, professing sympathy with Freedom,
who still votes with this party, to him I would
say: The name of Democrat is a tower of strength; let
it not be the bulwark of Slavery; for the sake of a
name do not sacrifice the thing; for the sake of party
do not surrender Freedom.</p>

<p>According to familiar rule, handed down from distant
antiquity, we are to say nothing but good of the dead.
How, then, shall I speak of the late powerful Whig
party, by whose giant contests the whole country was
once upheaved, but which has now ceased to exist, except
as the shadow of a name? Here in Massachusetts,
a few who do not yet know that it is dead
have met together and proffered the old allegiance.
They are the Rip Van Winkles of our politics. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
respectable character, falling asleep in the mountains,
drowsed undisturbed throughout the war of the Revolution,
and then, returning to his native village, ignorant
of all that had passed, made haste to declare himself
“a loyal subject of the King, God bless him!” But our
Whigs are less tolerant and urbane than this awakened
sleeper. In petulant and irrational assumption they are
like the unfortunate judge, who, being aroused from
slumber on the bench by a sudden crash of thunder,
exclaimed, “Mr. Crier, stop the noise in Court!” The
thunder would not be hushed; nor will the voice of
Freedom, now reverberating throughout the land. Some
there are among these who openly espouse the part of
Slavery, while others, by indifference, place themselves
in the same unhappy company. If their position at this
moment were of sufficient importance to justify grave
remark, they should be exhibited as kindred in spirit
and isolation to the Tories of our Revolution, or at
least as the Bourbons of Massachusetts,&mdash;always claiming
everything, learning nothing, forgetting nothing, and
at last condemned by an aroused people for disloyalty
to Freedom. Let no person who truly loves Freedom
join this company, tempted by its name and old associations.</p>

<p>There is still another party claiming your votes, but
permit me to say, at this crisis, with little reason. I
am at a loss to determine the name by which it may
be called. It is sometimes styled the Know Nothing
party, sometimes the American party; but it cannot be
entitled to these designations,&mdash;if they be of any value,&mdash;for
it does not claim to belong to the organization
which first assumed and still retains them. It is an
isolated combination, peculiar to Massachusetts, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
while professing certain political sentiments, is bound
together by the support of one of the candidates for
Governor.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> At this moment this is its controlling idea.
It is therefore a <em>personal</em> party; and I trust that I shall
not be considered as departing from that courtesy which
is with me a law, if I say, that, in the absence of any appropriate
name, expressive of principles, it may properly
take its designation from the candidate it supports.</p>

<p>Of course such a party wants the first essential condition
of the organization which we seek. It is a <em>personal</em>
party, whose controlling idea is predilection for a
man, and not a principle. Whatever may be the private
sentiments of some of its members, clearly it is not a
party wedded to Freedom for better and for worse, and
clinging to it with a grasp never to be unloosed. While
professing opposition to Slavery, it also arraigns Catholics
and foreigners, and allows the question of their
privileges to disturb its energies. It is not all for Freedom;
nor is it, like Cæsar’s wife, above suspicion. Besides,
even as party of Freedom, it is powerless from its
isolation; for it stands by itself, and is in no way associated
with that great phalanx now rallying throughout
the North. In this condition should it continue
to exist, it will, in the coming Presidential contest, from
natural affinity, lapse back into the American party of
the country, which is ranged on the side of Slavery. Of
course, as a separate party, it is necessarily short-lived.
Cut off from the main body, it may show a brief vitality,
as the head of a tortoise still bites for some days
after it is severed from the neck; but it can have no
permanent existence. Surely this is not the party of
Freedom which we seek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>The incompetency of this party, as organ of our cause,
is enhanced by the uncongenial secrecy in which it had
its origin and yet shrouds itself. For myself let me
say, that on the floor of the Senate I have striven by
vote and speech, in conjunction with my distinguished
friend Mr. Chase, to limit the secret sessions of that
body, under shelter of which so much of the public
business is transacted; and I have there presented, as
the fit model for American institutions, the example
of that ancient Roman who bade his architect so construct
his house that all that he did might be seen by
the world.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> What I urged there I now urge here. But
the special aims which this party proposes are in harmony
with the darkness in which it begins. Even if
justifiable on any ground of public policy, they should
not be associated with our cause: but I am unwilling
to allude to them without expressing my frank
dissent.</p>

<p>It is proposed to attaint men for religion, and also for
birth. If this object can prevail, vain are the triumphs
of Civil Freedom in its many hard-fought fields, vain
is that religious toleration which we profess. The
fires of Smithfield, the tortures of the Inquisition, the
proscriptions of Non-Conformists may all be revived.
Mainly to escape these outrages, dictated by a dominant
religious sect, was our country early settled: in
one place by Pilgrims, who sought independence; in
another by Puritans, who disowned bishops; in another
by Episcopalians, who take their name from bishops;
in another by Quakers, who set at nought all forms;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
and in yet another by Catholics, who look to the Pope
as spiritual father. Slowly among the struggling sects
was evolved that great idea of the equality of all men
before the law without regard to religious belief; nor
can any party now organize a proscription merely for
religious belief, without calling in question this well-established
principle.</p>

<p>But Catholics are mostly foreigners, and on this account
are condemned. Let us see if there be any reason
in this; and here indulge me with one word on
foreigners.</p>

<p>With the ancient Greeks a foreigner was <em>a barbarian</em>,
and with the ancient Romans he was <em>an enemy</em>. In
early modern times the austerity of this judgment was
relaxed; but, under the influence of feudalism, different
sovereignties, whether provinces or nations, were kept
in a condition of isolation, from which they have gradually
passed, until now provinces are merged in nations,
and nations are giving signs that they too will
yet combine in one. In our country a new example is
already displayed. From all nations people commingle
here. As in ancient Corinth, by accidental fusion of
all metals, accumulated in the sacred temples, a peculiar
metal was produced, better than any individual
metal, even silver or gold,&mdash;so, perhaps, in the
order of Providence, by fusion of all races here, there
will be a better race than any individual race, even
Saxon or Celt. Originally settled from England, the
Republic has been strengthened and enriched by generous
contributions of population from Scotland, Ireland,
Switzerland, Sweden, France, and Germany; and
the cry is, Still they come! At no time since the discovery
of the New World has the army of emigrants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
pressed so strongly upon us. More than one quarter
of a million are annually landed on our shores. The
manner in which they shall be received is a problem
of national policy.</p>

<p>All will admit that any influence which they bring,
hostile to our institutions, calculated to substitute
priestcraft for religion and bigotry for Christianity,
must be deprecated and opposed. All will admit, too,
that there must be some assurance of their purpose to
become not merely consumers of the fruits of our soil,
but useful, loyal, and permanent members of our community,
upholders of the general welfare. With this
simple explanation, I cannot place any check upon the
welcome to foreigners. There are our broad lands,
stretching towards the setting sun; let them come and
take them. Ourselves children of the Pilgrims of a
former generation, let us not turn from the Pilgrims of
the present. Let the home founded by our emigrant
fathers continue open in its many mansions to the emigrants
of to-day.</p>

<p>The history of our country, in its humblest as well as
most exalted spheres, testifies to the merit of foreigners.
Their strong arms have helped furrow our broad territory
with canals, and stretch in every direction the iron rail.
They fill our workshops, navigate our ships, and even till
our fields. Go where you will among the hardy sons of
toil on land or sea, and there you find industrious and
faithful foreigners bending their muscles to the work.
At the bar and in the high places of commerce you find
them. Enter the retreats of learning, and there too you
find them, shedding upon our country the glory of science.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Nor can any reflection be cast upon foreigners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
coming for hospitality now, which will not glance at
once upon the distinguished living and the illustrious
dead,&mdash;upon the Irish Montgomery, who perished for
us at the gates of Quebec,&mdash;upon Pulaski the Pole,
who perished for us at Savannah,&mdash;upon De Kalb and
Steuben, the generous Germans, who aided our weakness
by their military experience,&mdash;upon Paul Jones,
the Scotchman, who lent his unsurpassed courage to the
infant thunders of our navy,&mdash;also upon those great
European liberators, Kosciusko of Poland, and Lafayette
of France, each of whom paid his earliest vows to
Liberty in our cause. Nor should this list be confined
to military characters, so long as we gratefully cherish
the name of Alexander Hamilton, who was born in the
West Indies, and the name of Albert Gallatin, who was
born in Switzerland, and never, to the close of his octogenarian
career, lost the French accent of his boyhood,&mdash;both
of whom rendered civic services to be commemorated
among the victories of peace.</p>

<p>Nor is the experience of our Republic peculiar. Where
is the country or power which does not inscribe the
names of foreigners on its historic scroll? It was Christopher
Columbus, of Genoa, who disclosed to Spain the
New World; it was Magellan, of Portugal, sailing in
the service of Spain, who first passed with adventurous
keel through those distant Southern straits which now
bear his name, and opened the way to the vast Pacific
Sea; and it was Cabot, the Venetian, who first conducted
English enterprise to this North American continent.
As in triumphs of discovery, so also in other fields have
foreigners excelled, while serving states to which they
were bound by no tie of birth. The Dutch Grotius,
author of the great work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span> “Laws of War and Peace,”
an exile from his own country, became Ambassador
of Sweden; and, in our own day, the Italian Pozzo di
Borgo, turning his back upon his own country, reached
the most exalted diplomatic trust in the jealous service
of Russia. In the list of monarchs on the throne
of England, not one has been more truly English than
the Dutch William. In Holland no ruler has equalled
in renown the German William, Prince of Orange. In
Russia the German Catharine the Second takes place
among the most commanding sovereigns. And who of
Swedish monarchs was a better Swede than Bernadotte,
the Frenchman? and what Frenchman was ever filled
with aspiration for France more than the Italian Napoleon
Bonaparte?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I pass from these things, which have occupied me too
long. A party, which, beginning in secrecy, interferes
with religious belief, and founds a discrimination on the
accident of birth, is not the party for us.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Where Liberty is, there is my country,” was the
sentiment of that great Apostle of Freedom, Benjamin
Franklin, uttered during the trials of the Revolution.
In similar strain, I would say, “Where Liberty is, there
is my party.” Such an organization is now happily
constituted here in Massachusetts, and in all the Free
States, under the name of <span class="smcap">Republican Party</span>.</p>

<p>In assuming our place as a distinct party, we simply
give form and direction, in harmony with the usage and
genius of popular governments, to a movement which
stirs the whole country, and does not find adequate and
constant organ in either of the other existing parties.
The early opposition to Slavery was simply a sentiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
outgushing from the hearts of the sensitive and
humane. In the lapse of time it became a determined
principle, inspiring larger numbers, and showing itself
first in an organized endeavor to resist the annexation
of slaveholding Texas; next, to prohibit Slavery in
newly acquired territories; and now, alarmed by the
overthrow of all rights in Kansas, and the domination
of the Slave Oligarchy throughout the Republic, it
breaks forth in a stronger effort, a wider union, and a
deeper channel, inspiring yet larger numbers and firmer
resolves, while opposite quarters contribute to its power,&mdash;even
as the fountain, first outgushing from the
weeping sides of its pure mountain home, trickles in
the rill, leaps in the torrent, and flows in the river, till,
at last, swollen with accumulated waters, it presses onward,
in irresistible, beneficent current, fertilizing and
uniting the spaces which it traverses, washing the feet
of cities, and wooing states to repose upon its banks.</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<p>Our party has its origin in the exigencies of the hour.
Vowing ourselves against Slavery, wherever it exists,
whether enforced by Russian knout, Turkish bastinado,
or lash of Carolina planter, we do not seek to interfere
with it at Petersburg, Constantinople, or Charleston;
nor does any such grave duty rest upon us. Political
duties are properly limited by political responsibilities;
and we are in no just sense responsible for the local
law or usage by which human bondage in these places
is upheld. But wherever we are responsible for the
wrong, there our duty begins. The object to which, as
a party, we are pledged, is all contained in acceptance
of the issue which the Slave Oligarchy tenders. To its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and its imperious
demand that Kansas shall be surrendered to Slavery,
we reply, that Freedom shall be made the universal law
of all the national domain, without compromise, and
that hereafter no Slave State shall be admitted into
the Union. To its tyrannical assumption of supremacy
in the National Government we reply, that the Slave
Oligarchy shall be overthrown. Such is the practical
purpose of the Republican Party.</p>

<h2><a name="ORIGINATION_OF_APPROPRIATION_BILLS" id="ORIGINATION_OF_APPROPRIATION_BILLS"></a>ORIGINATION OF APPROPRIATION BILLS.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on the Usurpation of the Senate in the
Origination of Appropriation Bills, February 7, 1856.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>On the 11th of December, 1855, Mr. Brodhead, of Pennsylvania,
introduced a resolution directing the Committee on Finance to consider
the expediency of reporting the appropriation bills for the support
of the Government. The resolution was allowed to lie on the table
till January 7, 1856, when it was called up for consideration, and
adopted. On the 4th of February, Mr. Hunter, of Virginia, Chairman
of the Committee on Finance, reported to the Senate the following
resolution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Committee on Finance be instructed to prepare and
report such of the general appropriation bills as they may deem expedient.”</p>

</div>

<p>The resolution was adopted by the Senate, February 7, but this was
all. Nothing was done under it.</p>

<p>This attempt was prompted by the protracted contest in the organization
of the House of Representatives, when, after one hundred and
thirty-three ballotings, Mr. Banks was chosen Speaker, February 2,
and the Slave Power received its first check.</p>

<p>In the course of the debate, February 7, Mr. Sumner spoke as follows.</p>

</div>


<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;Whatever the Senator from
New York [Mr. <span class="smcap">Seward</span>] touches he handles with
a completeness to render anything superfluous from one
who follows on the same side; but the opposition which
his views have encountered from the Senator from Virginia
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Hunter</span>], and also from the Senator from
Georgia [Mr. <span class="smcap">Toombs</span>], as well as the intrinsic importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
of the question, may justify the attempt to state
the argument anew.</p>

<p>We are carried first to the words of the Constitution,
which are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House
of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur
with amendments, as on other bills.”</p>

</div>

<p>Under this provision, the annual appropriation bills
for the Army, Navy, Post-Office, and civil and diplomatic
service, from the beginning of the Government,
have originated in the House of Representatives; and
this has always been so, I believe, without question. It
is now proposed to reverse the standing policy, and to
originate such bills in the Senate; and this proposition
has the sanction of the Committee on Finance.</p>

<p>The proposition is a clear departure from usage, and on
this account must be regarded with suspicion. A slight
examination will demonstrate that it tends to subvert
well-established landmarks.</p>

<p>By looking at the debates in the Convention which
framed the National Constitution, it will be found that
this clause was not hastily or carelessly adopted,&mdash;that it
was the subject of much discussion, and was viewed as
essentially important in establishing the system of checks
and balances peculiar to our Republic. It was, indeed,
part of the compromise between the small States and the
large States.</p>

<p>After much consideration, the <em>equality of the States</em>
was recognized in the Constitution of the Senate, and
small States, like Delaware and Rhode Island, were
allowed, in this body, equal power with large States, like
Virginia and Massachusetts. But this great concession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
to the small States was coupled at the time with a condition
that “money bills” should originate in the House
of Representatives, where the people were represented
according to numbers. The language finally employed
was, “All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the
House of Representatives.” This was adopted, as compensation
to the large and populous States for their comparative
weakness in the Senate.</p>

<p>That I do not go too far, when I call it part of the compromise
between the great States and small States, I proceed
to show, from the debates in the National Convention,
as reported by Mr. Madison, how it was regarded
there.</p>

<p>The provision owes its authoritative introduction to
Dr. Franklin, who moved it in the committee which
subsequently reported it.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Afterwards, in Convention,
when the clause relating to <em>equality of votes</em> was under
consideration, we have this report of what he said.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Dr. Franklin observed, that this question could not be
properly put by itself, the Committee having reported several
propositions as <em>mutual conditions of each other</em>. He could not
vote for it, if separately taken, but should vote for the whole
together.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Colonel Mason, of Virginia, was of the same opinion,
and desired “that the whole might be brought <em>into one
view</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Gerry, of Massachusetts, followed up the idea of
the mutual dependence of the two propositions, remarking,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He would not say that the concession was a sufficient one
on the part of the small States; but he could not but regard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>it in the light of a <em>concession</em>. It would make it a constitutional
principle, that the second branch were not possessed of
the confidence of the people in <em>money matters</em>,”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Please, Sir, to mark the breadth of this expression.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>&mdash;“which would lessen their weight and influence.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Pinckney, of South Carolina, followed, saying,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He thought it evident that the concession was wholly on
one side, that of the large States; the privilege of originating
<em>money bills</em> being of no account.”<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At a later stage of the debates the subject was resumed,
and the two propositions still appear together.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Rutledge [of South Carolina] proposed to reconsider
the two propositions touching the originating of <em>money bills</em>
in the first, and the <em>equality of votes</em> in the second branch.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Sherman [of Connecticut] was for the question on the
whole at once. It was, he said, <em>a conciliatory plan</em>. It had
been considered in all its parts.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Luther Martin [of Maryland] urged the question on
the whole. He did not like many parts of it.&hellip; He
was willing, however, to make trial of the plan, rather than
do nothing.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Gerry [of Massachusetts] did not approve of a reconsideration
of the clause relating to <em>money bills</em>. It was of
great consequence. <em>It was the corner-stone of the accommodation.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At a still later stage Mr. Pinckney moved to strike
out the section on money bills, “as giving no peculiar
advantage to the House of Representatives, and as clogging
the Government.” Mr. Gorham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span> “was against allowing
the Senate to <em>originate</em>, but was for allowing it
only to <em>amend</em>.” Mr. Gouverneur Morris urged, that it
was “particularly proper that the Senate should have
the right of originating <em>money bills</em>. They will sit constantly,
will consist of a smaller number, and will be
able to prepare such bills with due correctness, and so
as to prevent delay of business in the other House.”
To all this Colonel Mason replied, in the strong language
which seems to have been natural to him, that
he “was unwilling to travel over this ground again.
<em>To strike out the section was to unhinge the compromise
of which it made a part.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>I might adduce other authorities; but here surely is
enough to show that the provision was in reality one
of the important compromises of the Constitution.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This brings me, Sir, to the precise meaning of the provision.
The seeming indefiniteness of the term, “bills
for raising revenue,” may alone furnish apology for the
present debate. It may be argued, that, while the Senate
is placed under certain restrictions, it may nevertheless
originate “appropriation bills.” This, of course, is
a question of interpretation. Does this interdict upon
the Senate extend to bills by which money is appropriated
to the support of Government, as well as to bills by
which it is directly obtained? Are appropriation bills
included under the term, “bills for raising revenue”?
Now I cannot accord with opinions so confidently expressed
by the Senator from Virginia [Mr. <span class="smcap">Hunter</span>],
and the Senator from Georgia [Mr. <span class="smcap">Toombs</span>], that it
was clearly the intention of the Constitution to concede
to the Senate the power of originating all appropriation
bills; nor, on the other hand, do I assert that such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
exercise of power is in the strict sense unconstitutional.
I approach the question as an inquirer anxious to find
the real purpose.</p>

<p>Several considerations seem to shed light on the path
to our conclusion.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> The compromise between the small States and
large States can be made completely effective, according
to obvious intent of the authors of the Constitution, only
by interdicting the Senate from originating the great
appropriation bills. If this interdict is restricted simply
to tariff bills, which occur only at rare intervals, it becomes
a very inadequate compensation for the surrender
by the large States to the small States in the constitution
of the Senate. According to the reason of the rule,
the great appropriation bills must be equally within its
intendment. The reason is as strong in one case as in
the other.</p>

<p>In the debates of the Convention, Dr. Franklin said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As it had been asked what would be the use of restraining
the second branch from meddling with <em>money bills</em>, he
could not but remark, that it was always of importance that
the people should know who had disposed of their money,
<em>and how it had been disposed of</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Please, Sir, to mark these words.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was a maxim, that those who feel can best judge.
This end would, he thought, be best attained, if <em>money
affairs</em> were to be confined to the immediate representatives
of the people.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Gerry, in urging the restraint upon the Senate,
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The other branch was more immediately the representatives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>of the people, <em>and it was a maxim that the people ought
to hold the purse-strings</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

</div>

<p>How, Sir, can the people hold the purse-strings, unless
they hold the bills by which the purse is appropriated?</p>

<p>And Colonel Mason broke forth in language clearly
revealing his sense of danger against which to guard.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If the Senate can originate, they will, in the recess of
the legislative sessions, hatch their mischievous projects for
their own purposes, and have their <em>money bills</em> cut and dried
(to use a common phrase) for the meeting of the House of
Representatives.”<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I repeat, then, according to the reason of the rule,
the great appropriation bills must be embraced by the
prohibition.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> There is a further consideration, founded on
the familiar use of the term <em>money bills</em> throughout the
debates in the Convention, as applicable to bills which
the Senate cannot originate. I need not occupy time
by reference to instances; but whoever takes the trouble
to investigate the matter in Mr. Madison’s report of the
debates, and also in the report of the Virginia Convention,
will find that this term is universally employed,&mdash;unless,
indeed, where Mr. Gouverneur Morris uses the
broader term “money plans,”<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and Mr. Gerry “money
matters.”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Now all these phrases are clearly applicable
to “appropriation bills,” by which the Government
is carried on; and the inference seems irresistible, that
the parties who used them must have had such bills in
mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>In the Virginia Convention objection was made by
Mr. Grayson “to the power of the Senate to propose or
concur with <em>amendments to money bills</em>.” The objection
is even to “amendments.” He pronounced this “a departure
from that great principle which required that
the <em>immediate representatives</em> of the people only should
interfere with <em>money bills</em>.&hellip; The Lords in England
had never been allowed to intermeddle with money bills.
He knew not why the Senate should.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> This brings me to another consideration,
founded on the example of England, which was obviously
present to the framers of the Constitution. The
Senator from Virginia [Mr. <span class="smcap">Hunter</span>] is clearly mistaken
on this point. It was often adduced in debate in the
National Convention, and, as we have just seen, in the
Virginia Convention also. In England the rule is explicit,
and of ancient date. As early as July 3, 1678,
the Commons resolved:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That all aids and supplies, and aids to his Majesty in
Parliament, are the sole gift of the Commons; <em>and all bills
for the granting of any such aids and supplies ought to begin
with the Commons; and that it is the undoubted and sole right
of the Commons to direct, limit, and appoint, in such bills, the
ends, purposes, considerations, conditions, limitations, and qualifications
of such grants</em>, which ought not to be changed or
altered by the House of Lords.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In pursuance of this rule, estimates for the annual
expenditure are submitted by the Ministry to the House
of Commons, sitting as a Committee of Supply. This
process is explained as follows.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The member of the Administration representing the department
for which the supplies are required first explains
to the Committee such matters as may satisfy them of the
correctness and propriety of the estimates, and then proceeds
to propose each grant in succession, which is put from the
Chair in these words: ‘That a sum not exceeding &mdash;&mdash; be
granted to her Majesty, for the object specified in the estimate.’ &hellip;
The Committee of Supply votes every sum
which is granted annually for the public service,&mdash;the army,
the navy, the ordnance, and the several civil departments.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At the close of the session all the grants are embodied
in a bill, which is known as “Appropriation Bill,” and,
as it is kindred in character to that under our system,
doubtless has given its name to ours. This bill is thus
described:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It enumerates every grant made during the whole session,
and authorizes the several sums, as voted by the Committee
of Supply, to be issued and applied to each service.”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus, on three grounds,&mdash;first, by the reason of the
thing,&mdash;secondly, by the familiar use in all the debates
of the descriptive term, “money bills,”&mdash;and, thirdly,
by the example of England,&mdash;the conclusion is inevitable,
that “appropriation bills,” <em>by which the Government
is carried on</em>, are within the spirit of the interdict
upon the Senate, and that this body cannot originate
such bills without violation of a well-established principle
inherited from English jurisprudence, and also
without <em>unhinging</em>, according to the language of Colonel
Mason, that compromise by virtue of which the small
States are admitted to equality of representation on this
floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>I am not unmindful of the fact, on which the Senator
from Virginia has dwelt so emphatically, that the
Senate is in the habit of originating pension bills, also
bills for payment of private claims, and kindred measures.
I was glad, to-day, to vote for the bill originating
in this body for the relief of our late distinguished
Minister at Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> But against this usage,
which is exceptional in character, and has probably attracted
little attention, from its considerable convenience
and little importance, may be opposed the uniform
practice by which the great bills providing for the necessities
of the Government have always originated in
the House of Representatives. And you will bear in
mind, Sir, that the question is now on these bills.</p>

<p>Mr. President, it is a received maxim, that it is the
part of a good judge to amplify his jurisdiction; but it
will hardly be accepted, that it is the part of the American
Senate to amplify its powers, particularly in derogation
of the popular branch. And it surely cannot escape
observation, that the present effort is launched at
a moment when the popular branch promises to differ
from the Senate on important questions of national
policy. I am not insensible to the public convenience,
which has been pressed in this debate; but permit me
to say, Sir, that, should this convenience require the
proposed departure from our standing policy, we shall
be wise, if we hearken to the counsels of the Senator
from New York, and refrain from any innovation, unless
assured of the consent and coöperation of the other
House.</p>

COAST.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Letter to the Director of the Exchange News-Room, Boston,
February 18, 1856.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Senate Chamber</span>, February 18, 1856.</p>

<p class="dropcap">DEAR SIR,&mdash;I have pleasure in acknowledging the
receipt of the memorial, forwarded by you from
the underwriters and merchants of Boston, and addressed
to the Secretary of the Treasury, asking the despatch of
immediate relief to the large fleet of vessels now distressed
by the rigors of this severe winter on our northern
coast. It reached me Sunday morning; but its
charitable object did not allow delay, and on that day I
placed the memorial in the hands of the Secretary.</p>

<p>I have his verbal answer to-day, expressing great interest
in the object of the memorial, but saying, that, beyond
the revenue cutter, the Treasury Department has no
vessel at Boston which can be detached on this service,
and that the cutter was directed some weeks ago to do
what it could for the relief of distressed vessels.</p>

<p>Though the memorial was addressed to the Secretary
of the Treasury, I felt it my duty to apply to the Secretary
of the Navy. He entered into the plan with much
benevolence, and expressed a desire to do all that the
means at his command would permit. The only vessel
at Boston in readiness is the steam-frigate Merrimack,
which is about to start on a “trial-trip” of one week,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
previous to a cruise of six months. This vessel has
already been ordered to make the week’s voyage direct
from Boston to Norfolk; but the Secretary will give
directions that she shall proceed to the Great Banks as
far as can be judiciously done, under the circumstances,
in order to afford relief to vessels in distress. He would
extend the cruise to a longer term at once, but the
contractors who have furnished her engines have certain
rights which he is bound to respect.</p>

<p>The Secretary authorizes me to say also that he will
send further relief, if possible.</p>

<p>I beg you to assure the memorialists that it will give
me pleasure to promote the objects of the memorial to
the full extent of my power.</p>

NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN NOW.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Letter to a Committee of the Boston Mercantile Library
Association, February 19, 1856.</span></p>

<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, February 19, 1856.</p>

<p class="dropcap">DEAR SIR,&mdash;I have been honored by your invitation
to be with the Mercantile Library Association
on the 22d instant. You know well the happiness I
find in any coöperation with the young men of that Association,
and I need not assure you of the gratification
with which I should participate in any services calculated
to exalt the example of Washington.</p>

<p>Particularly at this moment should it be invoked,
when the Republic, which he helped to found, seems to
shake with the first throes of civil war, engendered by
an interest which was condemned by him during life
and formally abjured by him at his death. His great
name should now be employed for the suppression of
that Slave Power which is the fruitful mother of so
much wretchedness. It will not be enough to quote
his paternal words for Union: his example must be arrayed
against the gigantic wrong which now disturbs
this Union to its centre, and, in the madness of its
tyranny, destroys the very objects of Union.</p>

<p>The play of Othello without the part of Othello would
be a barren spectacle; and the example of Washington,
without his testimony against the malevolent force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
which disturbs the Republic, would be hardly less barren.
Let the young men of Boston be encouraged to
dwell on those sentiments and acts which, while they
elevate his name, apply with prevailing power to the
existing state of things among us. Let them bear in
mind that he declared it to be “<em>among his first wishes</em>
to see some plan adopted by which Slavery in this
country may be <em>abolished by law</em>,”&mdash;that, to promote
this purpose, he expressed a desire, in a recorded interview
with a distinguished foreigner, for the formation
of an Antislavery Society,&mdash;that on many occasions he
condemned Slavery,&mdash;that, in congratulations to Lafayette
on his purchase of a plantation with a view of
emancipating the slaves on it, he exclaimed, “Would
to God a like spirit might diffuse itself generally into
the minds of the people of this country!”&mdash;and that,
finally, by his last will and testament, written within
six months of his death, he bore his practical testimony
to those ideas and aspirations, by the emancipation of
his slaves. With these things taken to heart, the example
of Washington will exert its just conservative
influence over the country, holding it back from the
extension of that evil against which he set himself, and
arousing the general sentiment to repulse the aggressions
which now threaten civil war. Then, indeed, will
the Father of his Country have a new birth and influence.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ABROGATION_OF_TREATIES" id="THE_ABROGATION_OF_TREATIES"></a>THE ABROGATION OF TREATIES.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Speeches in the Senate, March 6 and May 8, 1856.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The effort to obtain for the Senate the power to abrogate treaties
had peculiar interest at this time, from the known desire of certain
Senators to terminate the stipulation between the United States and
Great Britain, requiring a naval force on the coast of Africa for the
suppression of the slave-trade. In 1854 Mr. Slidell brought forward a
proposition to this effect in Executive Session, assuming that the stipulation
could be terminated by a simple vote of the Senate. Mr. Sumner
insisted that the prerogative belonged to the law-making power,
and could be exercised only by Act of Congress. By his effort the
proposition was defeated.</p>

<p>The power of the Senate over the abrogation of treaties was brought
forward in Legislative Session, on the motion of Mr. Sumner, in connection
with the Danish Sound dues, being the tax at Elsinore laid by
Denmark upon the cargoes of vessels passing through the Sound into
and out from the Baltic Sea. In 1841, Mr. Webster, as Secretary of
State, traced the origin of this tax to the treaty of 1645 between Denmark
and Holland, embracing a tariff of the principal articles then
known in commerce; which treaty was the basis of our own concluded
with Denmark in 1826, and limited to continue ten years from date,
and further until the end of one year after notice by either party of an
intention to terminate it; but he contented himself with recommending
friendly negotiations, “with a view of securing to the commerce of
the United States a full participation in any reduction of these duties,
or the benefits resulting from any new arrangements respecting them
which may be granted to the commerce of other states.”<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> In 1848, Mr.
Buchanan, as Secretary of State, instructed our Minister at Copenhagen,
that, “under the public law of nations, it cannot be pretended that
Denmark has any right to levy duties on vessels passing through the
Sound from the North Sea to the Baltic.” President Pierce, in his
annual message of 1854, proposed to terminate the treaty of 1826; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>Senate, by simple resolution in Executive Session, March 3, 1855, undertook
to terminate it; and the President, in his annual message of 1855,
announced that the proper notice had been given to Denmark.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Sumner, impressed with the conviction that this notice was
a bad precedent, and in the interest of the Slave Power, which controlled
the Senate, besides being inadequate under the Constitution,
brought forward the following resolution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Committee on Foreign Relations be directed to consider
the expediency of some act of legislation, having the concurrence of both
Houses of Congress, by which the treaty with Denmark regulating the payment
of Sound dues may be effectively abrogated, in conformity with the
requirements of the Constitution, under which every treaty is a part of ‘the
supreme law of the land,’ and in conformity with the practice of the Government
in such cases,&mdash;and especially to consider if such legislation be not
necessary forthwith, in order to supply a defect in the notice of the purpose
of the United States to abrogate the said treaty, which the President has undertaken
to give to Denmark without the authority of an Act of Congress,
and in disregard of the function of the House of Representatives in the
abrogation of all existing laws.”</p>

</div>

<p>On his motion the Senate proceeded to its consideration, March 6,
when he spoke as follows.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;If I can have the attention of
the Senate for a brief time, I will explain the
object of this inquiry. The subject may be dry, but
it is important, and, at this moment, of direct practical
interest.</p>

<p>The President in his annual message named three
different questions, arising out of our relations with
foreign nations. Two of these, concerning England,
have been discussed in the Senate; the other, which
concerns the payment of the Sound dues to Denmark,
has not yet been mentioned here. Introducing it now,
I have no purpose to say anything on the character of
these dues, or to arrest the efforts of the Government
for the relief of our commerce from foreign exactions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
That is a broad field of history and of public law, which
for the present there is no occasion to enter. My desire
is simply to open a question of domestic interest under
our own Constitution, with which, of course, Denmark
has no concern, but which is necessarily involved in the
determination of our course on this matter.</p>

<p>The President, in his annual message, announces:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In pursuance of the authority conferred by a resolution
of the Senate of the United States, passed on the 3d of
March last, notice was given to Denmark, on the 14th day
of April, of the intention of this Government to avail itself
of the stipulation of the subsisting convention of friendship,
commerce, and navigation, between that kingdom and the
United States, whereby <em>either party</em> might, after ten years,
terminate the same at the expiration of one year from the
date of notice for that purpose.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The treaty, it will be noted, reserves to <em>either party</em>&mdash;that
is, to <em>either of the Governments</em> between whom it is
made&mdash;the privilege of terminating it by notice; and
the President, without the sanction of an Act of Congress,
but simply in pursuance of a resolution of the
Senate, passed in Executive Session, <em>has constituted himself
the Government</em>, so far as to give such notice, and by
such notice to abrogate the treaty. Acting under his
instructions, our Minister at Copenhagen, on the 14th of
April, 1855, notified the Danish Government, that,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After the expiration of one year from the date of this
communication, the United States will regard the general
convention of ‘friendship, commerce, and navigation,’ agreed
upon by Denmark and themselves on the 26th of April,
1826, as <em>finally abrogated</em>, and that after that period its provisions
will not be binding upon our Government.”<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>Thus undertaking, merely with the consent of the
Senate, and without the concurrence of the House of
Representatives, to abrogate a treaty, the President has
assumed a power inconsistent with the Constitution, and
disowned by the practice of the Government, adopted,
after debate, on leading occasions. Such a usurpation
cannot be justified by the good that is sought; for that
good might have been sought, and may still be sought,
by another course, in entire harmony with the Constitution
and the practice of the Government. Nor will any
temporary purpose justify the removal of constitutional
safeguards.</p>

<p>The Constitution declares that the President “<em>shall
have power</em>, by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators
present concur”; but it does not declare that the
President, by and with the consent of the Senate, shall
have power to abrogate treaties. The absence of all
language conferring this extraordinary power is itself
an unanswerable argument against the existence of the
power. But we are not left to found our conclusion
even on irresistible inference. There are explicit words
of the Constitution, which determine it beyond doubt.
It is declared, that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This Constitution, and the laws of the United States
which shall be made in pursuance thereof, <span class="smcap">AND ALL TREATIES
MADE</span> <em>or which shall be made under the authority of the United
States</em>, <span class="smcap">SHALL BE THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Thus declaring treaties to be “the supreme law of the
land,” the Constitution not only gives to them the highest
authority, but places them under the highest safeguard
known to our institutions. When once made,
they are obligatory on our side as <em>laws</em>, and can be abrogated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
by no power less than that which may abrogate
existing laws. Not the President alone, not the President
and Senate, can set them aside; but for this
purpose the whole power of the Government must be
invoked, in its most solemn form, by Act of Congress.
In conformity with this requirement, the power to declare
war, involving, of course, the abrogation of treaties,
is expressly lodged with Congress. The President, with
the consent of the Senate, cannot declare war; and it is
difficult to see what greater power he possesses in the
abrogation of a treaty, involving possibly the rupture of
friendly intercourse with a foreign nation, and involving
certainly the overthrow of what the Constitution declares
to be the supreme law.</p>

<p>Thus placing treaties under all the sanctions of law,
I follow the best authorities. The eminent commentator,
Mr. Justice Story, in speaking of them, gives them
this character. Expounding this very clause, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is therefore indispensable that they should have the
obligation and force of a law, that they may be executed by
the judicial power, <em>and be obeyed like other laws</em>. This will
not prevent them from being cancelled or abrogated by the
nation, upon grave and suitable occasions; for it will not be
disputed <em>that they are subject to the legislative power, and may
be repealed, like other laws, at its pleasure</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And the Supreme Court of the United States affirm
the same principle.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A treaty is in its nature a contract between two nations,
not a legislative act.&hellip; In the United States a
different principle is established. <em>Our Constitution declares a
treaty to be the law of the land.</em> It is consequently to be re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>garded
in courts of justice as <em>equivalent to an Act of the Legislature</em>,
whenever it operates of itself, without the aid of any
legislative provision.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is a decision comparatively recent. But early
in our history the authority of treaties was much considered
by the Supreme Court, in the famous case of
<i>Ware</i> v. <i>Hylton et al.</i>, 3 Dallas, 199-285, and we find
judges from opposite sections of the country arriving at
the same conclusion. Mr. Justice Gushing, of Massachusetts,
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The treaty &hellip; is of <em>equal force</em> with the Constitution
itself, and <em>certainly with any law whatsoever</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Justice Iredell, of North Carolina, passed directly
upon the power of Congress, asserting that to this body
alone was given the power to abrogate a treaty under
our Constitution. These are his words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is a part of the Law of Nations, that, if a treaty be
violated by <em>one party</em>, it is at the option of <em>the other party</em>, if
innocent, to declare, in consequence of the breach, that the
treaty is void. <em>If Congress, therefore, who, I conceive, alone
have such authority under our Government</em>, shall make such
a declaration in any case like the present, I shall deem it
my duty to regard the treaty as void.”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In practical illustration of the legal character attributed
to treaties, it will be observed that they are published
with <em>the Laws of the United States</em>, and constitute part
of this collection, being bound between the same covers;
and I submit that the President and Senate might undertake
to tear out a leaf from the Statutes at Large with
as much propriety as to tear out an existing treaty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p>Such is the rule of the Constitution, in conformity with
which is the practice of the country. Never before has
the President assumed to act without the House of Representatives
in the performance of this duty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This question arose early after the adoption of the
Constitution, in our relations with France; and you
will find, Sir, on our statute-book the evidence of the
way in which it was regarded. In 1798, the existing
treaties with France were abrogated by Act of Congress,
which, after a preamble, proceeded as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States of America in Congress assembled</i>, That
the United States are of right freed and exonerated from the
stipulations of the treaties and of the consular convention
heretofore concluded between the United States and France,
and that the same shall not henceforth be regarded as
legally obligatory on the Government or citizens of the
United States.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This very Act of Congress originated in the Senate,
which at that day undertook to exercise no such power
as is now claimed. It was not passed hastily, or without
debate. The subject of our relations with France
was referred to a committee of that body on the 29th
of November, 1797. After the lapse of months, on the
21st of June, 1798, Mr. Goodhue, from that committee,
reported a bill to abrogate existing treaties with that
nation, which passed the Senate on the 23d of June,
by a vote of thirteen yeas to five nays. On the 25th it
was carried to the House of Representatives, where it
was referred to the Committee of the Whole on the
State of the Union, fully debated, and finally passed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
the 6th of July. In the course of the debate, <em>treaties
were recognized as laws, to be abrogated only by Act of
Congress</em>. A Representative from Massachusetts, afterwards
an eminent judicial character, Mr. Sewall, put
this point in these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is certainly a novel doctrine to pass a law declaring
a treaty void; but the necessity arose from the peculiar
situation of this country. In most countries it is in the
power of the Chief Magistrate to suspend a treaty, whenever
he thinks proper. <em>Here Congress only has that power.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This view was in no respect controverted or questioned.
On the contrary, it was recognized by the
whole debate. Mr. Dana, of Connecticut, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“France has violated the faith pledged by her treaties with
America. This, by the Law of Nations, <em>puts it within the
option of the Legislature to decide</em>, as a question of expediency,
whether the United States shall any longer continue to observe
their stipulations.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Gallatin, whose position in our public affairs was
afterwards so justly distinguished, employed the very
language applicable to laws, when he spoke of the proposed
abrogation of the treaty as a <em>repeal</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He knew of no precedent of a Legislature <em>repealing a
treaty</em>. It is therefore an act of a peculiar kind, and it appeared
to him necessary that <em>Congress</em> should justify it by a
declaration of their reasons.&hellip; It is not sufficient to say,
that, because a treaty has been violated, <em>we will repeal it</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such is the first and leading precedent in our history.
The next is more recent, and of hardly less importance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
It was the notice to Great Britain of the termination of
the convention of 1827, relating to the joint occupancy
of certain parts of Oregon. This was not done by the
President, with the advice of the Senate in secret session,
but by Act of Congress. President Polk, in his
annual message of 2d December, 1845, called upon
Congress to act. These are his words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Under that convention, a year’s notice is required to be
given by <em>either party</em> to the other, before the joint occupancy
shall terminate, and before either can rightfully assert or
exercise exclusive jurisdiction over any portion of the territory.
This notice it would, in my judgment, be proper to
give; <em>and I recommend that provision be made by law for giving
it accordingly</em>, and terminating in this manner the convention
of the 6th of August, 1827.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In pursuance of this recommendation, <em>provision was
made by law for this notice</em>. You will remember, Sir,
the debate which for months occupied both Houses of
Congress, and was closed by the passage of a joint resolution,
approved 27th April, 1846, which, after a preamble,
proceeds as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress assembled</i>, That the
President of the United States be, and he is hereby, authorized,
at his discretion, to give to the Government of Great
Britain the notice required by the second article of the said
convention of the sixth of August, 1827, for the abrogation
of the same.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This instance is particularly in point; for the treaty
was terminated, in accordance with its stipulations, by
notice from the United States,&mdash;precisely as it is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
proposed to terminate the treaty with Denmark. And
the notice given to Great Britain with regard to the treaty
is declared to be “for the abrogation of the same.”</p>

<p>Such, Sir, is the rule of the Constitution, sustained by
authoritative precedents, in the abrogation of successive
treaties with two powerful nations, France and Great
Britain. Surely there cannot be one rule for large nations
and another for small nations; nor will any one
argue that a treaty with France or Great Britain can be
abrogated only by Act of Congress, but a treaty with
Denmark may be abrogated by the President without an
Act of Congress. And yet, in apparent harmony with
this fallacious distinction, the Executive, merely with
the consent of the Senate, obtained in secret session, assumes
to abrogate a treaty with weaker Denmark, and
has given notice that this abrogation will take effect on
the ensuing 14th of April. Not content with the <em>treaty-making</em>
power which it possesses under the Constitution,
it assumes the <em>treaty-abrogating</em> power, which it does not
possess. And this assumption becomes more objectionable,
when it is considered how completely it excludes the
House of Representatives from an important function
in the Government. Louis the Fourteenth, in the pride
of conscious power, exclaimed, “I am the State”; and
permit me to say, that our own Executive, undertaking
to act in this matter without the sanction of Congress,
effectively makes the same declaration. To the Senate is
justly accorded large powers; but it now assumes more.
Only lately it authorized the origination of the great
appropriation bills, constituting the mainspring of the
Government, in defiance of uninterrupted usage, and, as
I submit, the spirit of the Constitution. What next, Sir?
“Glamis thou art, and Cawdor!” And where, Sir, in
this career of aggrandizement, will you stop?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever may be the merits of the existing controversy
with Denmark, I trust that the President will not
clutch so eagerly at the promised fruits as to disregard
the requirement of the Constitution, and the voice of
the popular branch, in the repeal of an existing law. In
vain you will urge the good accomplished. To do even
a great right, it is not safe to do even a little wrong. At
all events, I call attention to this extraordinary assumption,
that it may not be recorded for a precedent. I call
attention to it, also, that the needful steps may be taken
forthwith, in order to make effective the notice which
has been given, without due authority under the Constitution.
The treaty with Denmark is at this moment
part of the supreme law of the land, and can be abrogated
only by Act of Congress.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>A debate ensued, in which the conclusions of Mr. Sumner were maintained
by Mr. Seward, of New York, Mr. Fessenden, of Maine, Mr.
Collamer, of Vermont, Mr. Crittenden, of Kentucky, and Mr. Stuart,
of Michigan,&mdash;and controverted by Mr. Mason, of Virginia, Mr. Toucey,
of Connecticut, and Mr. Cass, of Michigan. Mr. Mason proposed to
amend the pending resolution by striking out the second clause, which
amendment Mr. Sumner at once accepted, and closed the debate as
follows.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;My desire is simply to bring the
question before the Committee, and, to accomplish this,
I shall not stand on the form of the resolution. I am
aware that it is argumentative, and involves, perhaps, a
reflection upon the course of the Executive; but I adopted
this form purposely, from a desire that the resolution
should tell the whole story on its face, and speak for
itself. The ample debate that has occurred supersedes
all such desire. The subject is fully before the Senate,
and I doubt not will receive the attention of the Committee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>In introducing this question, I remarked that it was
of domestic concern under our own Constitution, with
which, of course, Denmark has nothing to do. All references,
therefore, to that power have been superfluous, if
not illogical. Her consent is not sought in the proposed
termination of the treaty. On the contrary, it will be
terminated against her desires. We must look for our
rule of conduct to our own Constitution. This I assume
as an undeniable postulate.</p>

<p>The discussion, though protracted, has not been unprofitable;
but at each stage we have been brought back
to the clear and unmistakable distinction between the
power to make treaties and the power to abrogate them,
under the Constitution. The President, by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate, may make treaties;
but there is nothing in our Constitution conferring upon
them the power to abrogate treaties. To attribute to
them any such power is to go beyond the Constitution.
Nor has any Senator distinctly, and in terms, claimed
for them this power. On the contrary, I think that
Senators on the other side&mdash;both the Senator from Virginia
and the Senator from Connecticut&mdash;admit that a
treaty cannot be abrogated, except by virtue of an Act
of Congress. I understood the Senator from Connecticut
to make this admission, and I believe the Senator
from Virginia did also.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mason</span> nodded assent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Toucey.</span> I mean, except by Act of Congress or a new
treaty.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I put aside the whole idea of a new
treaty, constituting in itself a new transaction, and
involving the concurrence of the foreign power. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
President and Senate, with the concurrence of a foreign
power, may, of course, make a new treaty; but we are
now dealing with the case where the whole proceeding
is without any such concurrence. The question does
not turn on the <em>treaty-making</em> power, but on the <em>treaty-abrogating</em>
power. And I come back again to the admission
of both Senators, that a treaty can be abrogated
only by Act of Congress. This admission is important,
and, as it seems to me, conclusive.</p>

<p>But here a distinction is made by these Senators
between treaties which contain no provision for their
termination and treaties which contain such provision.
And I understand the Senator from Virginia to maintain
that a treaty terminated in pursuance of such a provision
is not <em>abrogated</em>. This is strange; for in both
cases the treaty is brought to an end by our special intervention,
and this is done <em>without the concurrence of
the other contracting party</em>. If this is not the abrogation
of a treaty, I do not see what can be. You may, if you
choose, call it by a softer term, but still it is the same
thing. The treaty is invalidated, or made to cease. But
I will not argue this question. I submit to Senators
opposite, who have maintained their views with so
much constancy, that their position is not tenable; I
say this frankly, but with entire respect for their learning
and ability. The same power must be invoked to
terminate a treaty containing a provision for its termination,
on notice from <em>either party</em>, as to terminate a
treaty containing no such provision; and in both cases
the treaty may properly be said to be abrogated. The
single distinction between the two cases is, that the
treaty in one case is abrogated in defiance of the other
party, and perhaps on hostile ground, while in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
other case it is abrogated in pursuance of a power
specially reserved, and therefore without any just cause
of offence; but in both cases the life of the treaty is
destroyed by our act. Permit me to add, that the distinction
made between these two classes is a distinction
without a difference, and the admission that a treaty can
be abrogated only by Act of Congress is as applicable to
one class as to the other: it settles the question.</p>

<p>I rest, then, confidently in the conclusion, that a
treaty is part of the supreme law of the land, and cannot
be set aside, terminated, superseded, disclaimed, repealed,
or abrogated, except by the exercise of the highest
power known to the Constitution, embodying the
collected will of the whole people in a legislative act,
under the sanction of the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States in Congress assembled.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The resolution, as modified, was adopted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the 7th of April, Mr. Mason, from the Committee on Foreign
Relations, reported the following resolution.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the notice which has been given by the President to Denmark,
pursuant to the resolution of the Senate of the 3d of March, 1855, to
terminate the treaty with that power of the 26th of April in the year 1826,
is sufficient to cause such treaty to terminate and be annulled to all intents
whatsoever, pursuant to the eleventh article thereof, and that no other or
further act of legislation is necessary to put an end to said treaty, as part of
the law of the land.”</p>

</div>

<p>This was considered May 8th, 1856, when Mr. Sumner spoke as
follows.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;As this subject was originally
brought before the Senate on my motion, I hope to
be indulged while I state briefly what seems to be the
true state of the question.</p>

<p>By the usage of most countries, the war-making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
power, the treaty-making power, and the treaty-abrogating
power are all lodged in one and the same body. For
instance, in England, the Queen in council declares war,
makes treaties, and also abrogates treaties: so also do
the other sovereigns of Europe. This is the growth of
custom, and has become European constitutional law.
But it is otherwise in the United States, where, according
to the Constitution, the war-making power is expressly
lodged in Congress, while the treaty-making
power is expressly lodged in the President, acting with
the advice of two thirds of the Senate. Nothing express
appears in the Constitution with regard to the treaty-abrogating
power. We are left to argument and inference,
in order to ascertain whether this great attribute
belongs with the war-making power to Congress, or with
the treaty-making power to the President and Senate.</p>

<p>To me there are three considerations, each of which
seems to be decisive, while the three combined compel
us irresistibly to the true conclusion.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> In the absence of any express words in the
Constitution, the power to abrogate treaties should not
be attributed to any <em>mere fraction</em> of the Government, as
to the President, or to the President and Senate, nor to
any branches short of the whole Government embodied
in an Act of Congress. In view of the magnitude of the
power, I am at a loss to see how any other conclusion
can be adopted on this point.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> The Constitution has expressly lodged the
war-making power in Congress, and, in doing so, seems by
implication to have placed the treaty-abrogating power
in the same body; for the latter seems to be an incident
of the former. The abrogation of a treaty may be the
prelude of war; indeed, it may practically amount to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
declaration of war. The powers, though differing in degree,
are kindred in character, and should go together.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> The Constitution has stepped forward, and
expressly declared that treaties shall be “the supreme
law of the land”; and I know no way in which these
words can have complete efficacy, unless they are held
to impress upon treaties <em>the character of law, so that they
will not only be recognized as such by the courts, but also
be irrepealable except by Act of Congress</em>.</p>

<p>And this conclusion is confirmed by the practice of
the Government on two important occasions, in abrogating
all subsisting treaties with France in 1798, and
in abrogating the convention with England relating to
Oregon as late as 1846. I do not dwell on these instances,
or their authoritative character; for I went
over them at length on a former occasion. Now, for the
first time in our history, an opposite practice is adopted,
contrary to precedents, and also, as it seems to me, contrary
to reason. It is proposed to terminate a subsisting
treaty with Denmark, establishing reciprocal privileges
of trade, and especially regulating the payment of Sound
dues, without any Act of Congress, but simply by virtue
of a resolution of the Senate. The novelty of this course
creates an impression against it. But this is vindicated
by the Committee on Foreign Relations, in an elaborate
report, on the ground of a peculiar provision in the
treaty, as follows.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The present convention shall be in force for ten years
from the date hereof, and further until the end of one year
<em>after either of the contracting parties</em> shall have given notice
to the other of its intention to terminate the same,&mdash;<em>each
of the contracting parties</em> reserving to itself the right
of giving such notice <em>to the other</em> at the end of the said
term of ten years; and it is hereby agreed between them,
that, on the expiration of one year after such notice shall
have been received <em>by either from the other party</em>, this convention
and all the provisions thereof shall altogether cease
and determine.”</p>

</div>

<p>It is admitted, as I understand, that, without this provision,
the treaty could not be terminated, except by Act
of Congress; but it is said, that, under this provision, no
such Act is required. It is difficult to understand the
ground of this distinction; for there is nothing in this
provision to take power from Congress and confer it
upon the Senate alone. Point out the words, if they
exist. They are not there. How, then, can you infer
them? The treaty is to be terminated on notice from
<em>either party</em>; and this notice must proceed from <em>the
same power</em> which, in the absence of such provision,
would be competent to act. The mode of action is different,
but <em>the acting power</em> is the same in both cases.</p>

<p>This treaty may be terminated on notice from “either
of the contracting parties.” In other treaties, having a
similar provision, other equivalent terms are employed:
as in the treaty with Greece in 1837, and with Sardinia
in 1838, where the term “high contracting parties” is
employed; the treaty with Hanover in 1840, and with
the Hanseatic Republics in 1852, where the term “Government
of the United States on the one part” is employed;
and, again, in the treaty with New Granada in
1844, where the term “one of the two Governments” is
employed. These terms are all identical in meaning;
and they signify that the notice in all cases must be
<em>an act of the Government</em>.</p>

<p>Who, then, for this purpose, is the Government, under
the Constitution of the United States? Surely, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
power that can abrogate a treaty, and nothing short of
this; and this power, we have already seen, is represented
by an Act of Congress alone.</p>

<p>The Committee in their report, undertake to set forth
the difference between treaties which contain no provision
for their termination and those which do contain
such provision, as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The distinction in the character of the acts, in the one
class of treaties and in the other, consists in this: that in the
first class, as in the treaties with France in 1798, they were
annulled as to the other party, <i>se invito</i>; in the second, in
the case with England, they became null with the assent of
that power previously given.”</p>

</div>

<p>Permit me to say that this does not seem to be a correct
statement of the difference between the two classes;
for in both cases the treaties were annulled contrary to
the desire of the opposite party; and it is notorious that
the pending proceedings to annul the treaty with Denmark
are contrary to the desire of that power. No, Sir:
the difference between the two cases must be found in
something else, which seems to me palpable and unmistakable.
It is this.</p>

<p>By the Law of Nations, in the absence of any express
stipulation, a treaty is of perpetual obligation on both
parties,&mdash;to be abrogated only by a new treaty having
the assent of both parties, or by the act of one party, alleging
bad faith or hostile intent in the other, and on
this account declaring before the civilized world a release
from all its obligations. Such an act not only
operates upon the other party <i>in invitum</i>, but it is also
<em>offensive in character</em>. But if any express stipulation
is introduced, authorizing the termination of the treaty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
on notice from either party, then it may be abrogated in
conformity to the stipulation, even contrary to the desire
of the opposite party, <em>without giving cause of offence</em>;
and this will be found to be the sole practical distinction
between the two cases. In both, the same <em>power</em>
must be invoked; but it acts in different ways.</p>

<p>The question in the present case is of importance in
two aspects: <i>first</i>, as it involves the determination of a
question of political power under our Constitution; and,
<i>secondly</i>, as it may affect the interest of private individuals.</p>

<p>In the first aspect, the question would not be unimportant,
constitutionally, if the treaty with Denmark
were the only one affected by it; but the frequency of
the provision in recent treaties adds to its interest.
Unknown in early days, it makes its first appearance
as late as 1822 in a treaty with France, and then in
1826 in this very treaty with Denmark; but it has
been repeated constantly since. Here is a list, now in
my hand, of no less than <em>forty-six</em> different treaties of
the United States with <em>thirty-two</em> different foreign powers,
in which this provision will be found. Among
these is the important stipulation with Great Britain,
under which a squadron is kept on the coast of Africa
for the suppression of the slave-trade; and you are now
to determine whether the Senate will assume to itself
the extraordinary power now claimed over all these
treaties, or will leave it in the hands of Congress. And,
still further, if this power is assumed by the Senate,
can it be exercised by a mere majority, or will a vote of
two thirds be required? How shall this question be
decided? This very difficulty of detail helps point to
the true conclusion. But here is the list.</p>

<p>Are you aware, Sir, of the extent to which the abrogation
of this treaty may affect private interests, and
therefore directly raise for the judgment of the courts
the question of the validity of your proceeding? By
this treaty Danish ships and cargoes are put upon the
footing of those of the most favored nations, and exempted
from discriminating duties; but these privileges
must, of course, cease with the treaty. Now, if a Danish
vessel should arrive in the coming month at New
York, from St. Thomas, or at San Francisco, on her way
from Manila, as has latterly happened, the question
would at once be presented, whether the treaty had
been legally abrogated, so as to expose the vessel and
cargo to the discriminating duties and fees? That I
may not seem to imagine a case, I call your attention
to a list of these duties and fees.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>[Here Mr. Sumner went into details which are omitted. At this
stage he was interrupted by a question from a Senator.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Clayton.</span> I wish to ask the Senator, whether, in his
judgment, supposing the treaty to be abrogated, our Act of
Congress of 1828 would not authorize the executive department
of the Government to admit free of duty any articles
from Denmark?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator is, perhaps, right. The
President may remit these discriminating duties; but I
believe he can do it only after information from Denmark
as to her course. He cannot do it <em>at once</em>; and I
now refer to these duties simply to show that at this
moment, while I speak, a practical question may arise
in our courts, or at our custom-houses, as to the validity
of the act of abrogation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p>These things will at least make you hesitate before
you assert a power which is without precedent, and
which at a former day was disowned in this very case.
By referring to the published diplomatic correspondence,
it appears that Mr. Buchanan, when Secretary of State, in
a letter to our representative at Copenhagen, dated 14th
October, 1848, twice over recognized this power in Congress.
“<em>Congress</em> may, therefore, at any moment, authorize
the President to terminate this convention.” Mark,
Sir, he did not say the Senate, but Congress. And then
again he says: “It is probable that two years might
elapse before the existing convention could be terminated,
<span class="smcap">as an act must first pass Congress</span> <em>to enable
the President to give the required notice, after which a year
must expire before it could be rendered effectual</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> It appears,
also, that the House of Representatives, proceeding
on this understanding, had already initiated a joint
resolution on this subject, and therefore were in some
measure seized of it, when the Senate undertook to act
alone. It seems to me that the course you have commenced
should be retraced, and that a joint resolution,
or Act of Congress, for the abrogation of the treaty, should
be introduced at once, if it is considered, in the present
state of negotiations on this question among the European
nations, that the abrogation of the treaty should
be pressed immediately.</p>

<p>I desire the opinion of the Senate simply on the
necessity of present action by joint resolution,&mdash;leaving
to another time, or to the Committee, the question,
whether the joint resolution shall be prospective in its
operation, or retroactive, so as to take advantage of the
notice already given? In order to have a decision of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>this single point, I move to strike out all of the resolution
now pending after the word “<i>Resolved</i>,” and insert
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the Committee on Foreign Relations be instructed
to report a joint resolution of Congress, providing for the
effectual termination of the convention with Denmark of the
26th of April, 1826.”</p>

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The subject was debated by Mr. Stuart, Mr. Clayton, Mr. Hale,
Mr. Bayard, Mr. Toombs, Mr. Collamer, Mr. Benjamin, and Mr.
Crittenden, when the Senate adjourned without a vote. It rested
for a long time, when, on July 22d, while Mr. Sumner was absent
from the Senate, disabled by injuries, Mr. Mason moved it again.
The Senate refused to consider it by a vote of sixteen ayes to twenty
noes, and from that time it was abandoned. Since then treaties have
been abrogated by Act of Congress, and this may be considered the
established rule.</p>

<p>The question of the Sound Dues, out of which this debate arose, was
settled by “friendly negotiation,” according to the original suggestion
of Mr. Webster. An arrangement was made by the different powers
of Europe, March 14, 1857, capitalizing the tax levied by Denmark,
and assuming in ratable proportions the payment of the full sum on
condition that the tax should cease. The United States kept aloof
from this arrangement, but by separate treaty, April 11, 1857, obtained
the same immunity by paying 717,829 rix dollars, with the further
recognition of the treaty of 1826, except the article on the Sound
Dues.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on the Report of the Committee
on Territories, March 12, 1856.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The terrible strife which began with the Kansas and Nebraska Bill
was at its height during the winter. Freedom and Slavery were at
a death-grapple in the Territory. Organized bands proceeded from the
South, which were encountered by peaceful emigration from the North.
The whole country was aroused. South and North were in a flame. On
the one side there was a persistent effort to subject the Territory to
Slavery; on the other side an equally persistent effort to save it to
Freedom. At this stage, Mr. Douglas, from the Committee on Territories,
presented a very long Report, purporting to be on the affairs of
Kansas, where everything was represented unfavorably to the Northern
emigrants, and especially to the Emigrant Aid Society of Massachusetts.
This Report was read at the desk by its author, a course to
which the Senate was not accustomed. Mr. Collamer presented a Minority
Report, which he read at the desk also. As soon as the reading
was over, Mr. Sumner took the floor and made the following remarks.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;In those two reports the whole
subject is presented characteristically on both
sides. In the report of the majority the true issue is
smothered; in that of the minority the true issue stands
forth as a pillar of fire to guide the country. The first
proceeds from four Senators; but against it I fearlessly
put that report signed by a single Senator [Mr. Collamer],
to whom I offer my thanks for this service. Let
the two go abroad together. Error is harmless, while
reason is left free to combat it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>
<p>I have no desire to precipitate the debate on this
important question, under which the country already
shakes from side to side, and which threatens to scatter
from its folds civil war. Nor, indeed, am I disposed to
enter upon it, until I have the opportunity of seeing in
print the elaborate documents which have been read to-day.
But I cannot allow the subject to pass away, even
for this hour, without repelling at once, distinctly and
unequivocally, the assault which has been made upon
the Emigrant Aid Company of Massachusetts. That
Company has done nothing for which it can be condemned
under the laws and Constitution of the land.
These it has not offended in letter or spirit,&mdash;not in
the slightest letter, nor in the remotest spirit. It is
true, it has sent men to Kansas; and had it not a right
to send them? It is true, I trust, that its agents love
Freedom and hate Slavery; and have they not a right
to do so? Their offence has this extent, and no more.
Sir, to the whole arraignment of that Company, in the
report of the Committee on Territories, I now for them
plead, “Not guilty!” and confidently appeal to the
country for that honorable acquittal which is due to
their patriot services.</p>

<p>The outrages in Kansas are vindicated or extenuated
by the alleged misconduct of the Emigrant Aid Company.
Very well, Sir; a bad cause is naturally staked
on untenable ground. You cannot show the misconduct.
Any such allegation will fail. And you now
begin your game with loaded dice.</p>

<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Senate Chamber</span>, April 28, 1856.</p>

<p class="dropcap">DEAR SIR,&mdash;I cannot be at your proposed meeting,
where are to assemble the patriotism, intelligence,
and wealth of the metropolis; but I recognize its importance,
and cry to it <em>God-speed!</em></p>

<p>The work before us is plain. Kansas must be saved
from a tyrannical usurpation, under which Slavery has
been forcibly established on Free Soil. This is the
special object of labor to which we are summoned by
every consideration of regard for that distant Territory,
and also by every sentiment of love for our common
country. But this can be done only by her immediate
welcome into the Union, under her present Constitution,
as a Free State,&mdash;of course without recognition of the
usurping Tyranny. Upon this we must insist, as the
means essential to the end.</p>

<p>In achieving this result, an incidental good will be
accomplished, which of itself should impel us to any
exertion. The Slave Oligarchy has staked its power
in the National Government upon the support of this
usurpation. In the madness of its despotism, it has
selected a position the least tenable of all its assumptions.
To dislodge it from this position, and at the
same time from its disgusting supremacy in the National
Government, will be one and the same work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
And all this will be easy to do, if the good people
of the populous North, forgetting past differences, will
but rally together. <em>Union to save Kansas, and Union
to save ourselves</em>, should be the watchword.</p>

<p>On the 17th of March, 1856, Mr. Douglas introduced “A Bill to authorize
the People of the Territory of Kansas to form a Constitution
and State Government, preparatory to their Admission into the Union,
when they have the requisite Population.” Subsequently, Mr. Seward
moved, by way of substitute, another bill, providing for immediate
action, and entitled “A Bill for the Admission of the State of Kansas
into the Union.” Debate ensued, and was continued by adjournment
from time to time. In the course of this debate, on the 19th and
20th of May, Mr. Sumner made the following speech.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This speech found unexpected audience from an incident which followed
its delivery. It became a campaign document in the Presidential
election then at hand, and was circulated by the hundred thousand.
Besides reprint in newspapers, there were large pamphlet editions in
Washington, New York, Boston, and San Francisco. Editions appeared
in German and Welsh. It was reprinted in London, in a publication
by Nassau W. Senior, the eminent publicist and economist,
entitled “American Slavery: A Reprint of an Article on ‘Uncle Tom’s
Cabin’ in the ‘Edinburgh Review,’ and of Mr. Sumner’s Speech of the
19th and 20th of May, 1856.”</p>

<p>At the period of its delivery an intense excitement prevailed throughout
the country. At the North there was a deep sense of wrong, with
indignation at the pretensions of the Slave Power, yearning for a voice
in Congress that should speak out the general sentiment. These influences
reached Mr. Sumner before he spoke, in numerous letters.</p>

<p>Hon. William Jay, of New York, the able and eminent Abolitionist,
being on the point of sailing for Europe, wrote thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is with heavy forebodings in regard to Kansas that I leave the country.
I have long been convinced that the great obstacle to the cause of
human rights and the ultimate prosperity and freedom of our native land
is the corruption of the moral sense of our nation. We are very religious
as a people, so far as religion is convenient, and consistent with money-getting,
office, and power; but so far as it interferes with those pursuits, we
are a nation of infidels. To me it seems the Democratic party is utterly
and ostentatiously profligate, the unblushing advocates of human slavery
and piratical warfare, the most God-defying party which ever cursed our
country. As to Slavery, the Church is exerting a most corrupting influence.
Our cotton parsons preach to please the rich pew-holders, and are
becoming more and more bold in defending Slavery, while &mdash;&mdash; keeps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>watch and ward over the press of the Tract Society as the guardian of
human bondage, and decent men are not ashamed to give their hands to this
shameless renegade, this reproach to Christianity. The violence, insolence,
cruelty, and injustice springing from Slavery are gradually drifting into
anarchy,&mdash;and anarchy leads first to civil war, and then to military usurpation.</p>

<p>“But duty is ours, and events belong to Providence. I think all honest
men must now be convinced that nothing is gained to Freedom by compromises.
Had Webster been a true man, there would have been no trouble
about Kansas. I never see his portrait or bust without a shudder. I am
for bold deeds and bold language.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent2">‘Fear admitted into public councils</div>
<div class="verse">Betrays like treason.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“May God direct and bless you!”</p>

</div>

<p>Another friend wrote from Massachusetts as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Pardon me for the expression of an earnest wish to hear from you soon
on the Kansas Freedom Question. However ably &mdash;&mdash; and others have
treated it, and they have done noble things, I am persuaded that you can
impress the public mind with the magnitude of the momentous issue more
than any other man.</p>

<p>“Excuse me again for suggesting, that, as Douglas charges as a reason, or
pretence, for calling the Freedom party ‘Black Republicans,’ because, as
he says, their platform all relates to ‘the Nigger Question,’ it may with the
greatest force be retorted, that the party in power should justly be named
Black Democrats, because their whole foreign and domestic policy is dictated
by the slaveholding oligarchy, and basely surrenders every other
interest of the country to it, if it interfere.</p>

<p>“Especially, I know that it would exceedingly gratify the friends of
Freedom, if the arrogance and bullyism of Douglas could be signally rebuked,
and his faithlessness to the honor and welfare of his native land be
conspicuously exhibited.”</p>

</div>

<p>Eli Thayer, of Worcester, who, more than any other person, was
author of the system of emigration which was redeeming Kansas, addressed
Mr. Sumner as follows, under date of May 8.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am happy to learn that you intend to speak next Monday. In my
judgment that speech has a very important mission to perform, and I rejoice
that it is soon to be before the people. But there will be gnashing of
teeth among the defenders of Slavery. Be prepared, therefore, for the
worst of their endeavors.</p>

<p>“Your shafts will fall among them as did those of the far-shooting god
among the Greeks before the walls of Troy, when he punished them for
enslaving the daughter of his priest:&mdash;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Δεινὴ δὲ κλαγγὴ γένετ’ ἀργυρέοιο βιοῖο.</p>

</div>

<p>“My friend Mr. Williams will be present to hear you. I envy him the
pleasure of the occasion.</p>

<p>“May good fortune attend you!”</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Le Baron Russell, of Boston, an active member of the Emigration
Society, wrote, under date of May 11:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We have had enough of truckling in Northern men. It is time for us
to show that we mean to submit to the Southern bravado no longer. I have
always felt humiliated by the tone our men have taken in Congress, yielding
everything, and never daring to assert their rights or to exercise their
true power to crush these fellows into submission.”</p>

</div>

<p>Such was the prompting under which Mr. Sumner spoke, while the
whole country watched the debate. The response to the speech was in
harmony with the prompting.</p>

<p>The correspondent of the <i>New York Tribune</i> thus by telegraph described
the speech immediately after its delivery:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Senator Sumner’s Kansas speech is the most masterly, striking, and
scathing production of the session. The galleries were crowded with
intellect, beauty, and fashion, and the anterooms were also thronged.
His excoriation of Douglas was scornfully withering and scorching. He
designated Senator Butler as the Don Quixote of Slavery, and Douglas as
its Sancho Panza. Mr. Sumner never before made such an impression in
force, manner, and emphatic style. He was animated and glowing throughout,
hurling defiance among the opposition, and bravely denouncing the
Kansas swindle from first to last. Some passages quite electrified the
Chamber, and gave a new conception of the man. Finer effect has rarely
been produced.”</p>

</div>

<p>The scene was sketched by a correspondent of the <i>Missouri Democrat</i>,
at St. Louis, as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It may be rash to publish in Missouri a just estimate of the abilities of
an Abolitionist. Sectional opinion demands caricatures, and not portraits.
It views the leading men of the other section through the medium of its
fear, its hatred, or its contempt, and can recognize no likeness, unless the
features are distorted and the canvas is darkened, unless the countenance is
wicked and the figure hideous.</p>

<p>“Sumner had an audience calculated to arouse all his faculties, and to
remind him that his position was in many respects similar to that of Burke,
when he impeached Warren Hastings. His brother Senators were mostly
in their seats,&mdash;by no means a common occurrence. The lobbies were
crowded with the great outside politicians, of whom Senators and Members
are frequently the instruments, who originate and guide political movements
by means of the press. Francis P. Blair, and Thurlow Weed, and Robert J.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>Walker, and bevies of Southern delegates to the Cincinnati Convention were
there; and the young orators of the House were also there,&mdash;Stephens, the
keenest blade in the Proslavery ranks, looking as if his face was the battle-ground
of boyhood and old age, and Keitt, measuring himself silently with
Sumner, and doubtless thinking that the speech to which he was listening
so attentively was like a Burmese idol, a monster covered with jewels. The
ladies’ gallery was crowded to excess, and the fair ones overflowed into the
anteroom of the Senate. The letter-writers in double file occupied their own
gallery (for which their best thanks are due to John P. Hale), and passed
upon the speech as it gradually came forth. The people in compact mass
occupied the background.</p>

<p>“That Sumner displayed great ability, and showed that in oratorical
talent he was no unworthy successor of Adams, Webster, and Everett, no
one who heard him will deny. In vigor and richness of diction, in felicity
and fecundity of illustration, in breadth and completeness of view, he
stands unsurpassed. He laid the classics, the Gothic mythology, the imaginative
literature of Europe, and the Bible under tribute for imagery or
quotation. That he had the great speech of Cicero and the greater speech
of Burke in his mind’s eye, there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>“In his reply to Cass, Douglas, and Mason, who stung him into excitement,
he was more successful than at any other time. The collision
knocked fire from him; and well it might, for he was abused and insulted
as grossly as any man could be; but he replied successfully to the unmeasured
vituperation of Douglas, and the aristocratic and withering hauteur
of Mason.”</p>

</div>

<p>The able correspondent of the <i>Evening Post</i> at New York, William
S. Thayer, afterwards Consul-General at Alexandria, furnished this
description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is but one opinion among all competent judges as to the unexampled
feast of eloquence which has been enjoyed in the Senate for the past
two days, from the lips of Senator Sumner. In a speech of five hours in
length, he has exhibited the most signal combination of oratorical splendors
which, in the opinion of a veteran Senator, has ever been witnessed in that
Hall. Indeed, for the union of clear statement, close and well-put reasoning,
piquant personality and satire, freighted with a wealth of learned and
apposite illustrations, every one of which was subsidiary to the main purpose
of the argument, it may safely challenge comparison with the great
speeches of Burke, to whom the Massachusetts Senator, in the ripened vigor
of his abilities, and in his varied accomplishments, bears no small similitude.&hellip;
But Mr. Sumner was more fortunate than Burke in drawing and detaining
his audience.&hellip; From the beginning to the end of each session,
not only were the galleries thronged to their utmost capacities with ladies
and gentlemen, but all the doorways were completely blocked up with listeners
who hung in breathless suspense upon his eloquence. It seemed
even as if the members of the other House had adjourned to crowd the
lobbies of the Senate. No such scene has been witnessed since the days
of Webster.”</p>

</div>

<p>A writer in the <i>Liberator</i> thus recorded his impressions on reading
the speech:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Never, I think, from anything did I receive an impression of greater
power and grandeur. It came over me like the sound of many waters. I
laid down the paper, and still there seemed to press around me a solemn,
majestic anthem from a mighty organ. I can almost imagine that around
that sick-bed the invisible angels gather, and that on that bruised and
mangled head the rays of a divine halo gleam between the blossoms of an
imperishable wreath.”</p>

</div>

<p>Another writer, in a country journal of Massachusetts, expresses himself
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It were the merest commonplace to say that Massachusetts may well be
proud of her son. She owes him a debt which she can never fitly discharge.
I would avoid estimating him too highly; but it seems to me that it may be
said without extravagance, that to much of the firmly knit strength and
unassailable logic of a Webster he unites all the fire and fervor of an Otis,
with the grace and classic elegance of an Everett. But underlying, interpenetrating,
and informing all this brilliancy of genius is the earnest philanthropy
of the man,&mdash;a philanthropy which gives an effect to all his productions,
which the cold-blooded politician, or statesman, even, can never
hope to attain. His words go straight to the popular heart, and find there
an earnest and immediate response.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Rev. Gilbert Haven, in a published sermon at Westfield, Massachusetts,
spoke thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Read the great speech which excited such rage, and won for its author
the crown of a martyr. For, before he uttered a word, he knew its probable
effect; he measured the danger before he struck the blow. But three or
four in all history are its equals in beauty and strength of thought and language,&mdash;Demosthenes
against the Philipizing Douglas of Athens, the keen,
ready, insolent tool of her tyrants,&mdash;Cicero against the Atchison Catiline
of the Roman Republic,&mdash;Burke against the wholesale enslaver of India,
Hastings,&mdash;Webster against the South Carolinian traducer of Freedom and
its fruits: with these four, this stands, and will always stand, equal to the
highest in all the literary qualities of an oration, higher than the highest in
the sweep of his theme,&mdash;the preservation of the liberty, culture, and religion
of a great Christian nation.”</p>

</div>

<p>The testimony of the press was followed by that of correspondents,
who vied in grateful felicitations. Of these a few examples are given.</p>

<p>“I have read and re-read thy speech, and I look upon it as thy best. A
grand and terrible philippic, worthy of the great occasion; the severe and
awful truth which the sharp agony of the national crisis demanded. It is
enough for immortality. So far as thy own reputation is concerned, nothing
more is needed. But this is of small importance. We cannot see as
yet the entire results of that speech, but everything now indicates that it
has <em>saved the country</em>.”</p>

which has broken out in so disgraceful a manner at Washington; yet I am
happy to be able to congratulate you on standing so honorably as you do
in relation to this affair before the public, and that such public feeling is
manifested in relation to the transaction. I cannot but hope that the recent

an old German pupil, but not less so in form, for which likewise I have

<p>“Be assured, dear Sir, that you have gained a great many repenting sinners
from the ranks of the timid cotton-bound apologists of Southern tyranny.
Scarcely a man of intelligence and standing within my range of

stand right alongside with Webster’s reply to Hayne on the Foot resolution,
which was his greatest effort in my judgment, and will be considered equal
to it in apt classical allusion, strength of argument, bitter irony, and lofty
patriotism. Perhaps the only drawback in the comparison is the studied
arrangement of your speech, which, although assisting the memory in the

outrage that followed it. I cannot account for the course of Senator Butler,

thank God for enabling you to say just what you said, and to say it in the
very manner you did. And, Sir, you may well thank God, too. It required
no ordinary power. It was not the work of a day nor of a night, nor of successive
nights with lamps and ‘nigger boys.’ Douglas knows little of the

But the apprehension with which the first part of your remark filled me at
the time included nothing like this scene of murderous guilt. How could
it? How could any one, who had not measured all the length and breadth
of slaveholding depravity, as I had not, have brought such a thing within

confess I could find nothing in your Kansas Speech which offended either
my taste or my judgment. You rebuked States and individuals merely as

artifice, arrogance, and despotism it was necessary for you to portray
in connection with the subject under debate.”</p>

<h3>SPEECH.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;You are now called to redress
a great wrong. Seldom in the history of
nations is such a question presented. Tariffs, army
bills, navy bills, land bills, are important, and justly
occupy your care; but these all belong to the course
of ordinary legislation. As means and instruments only,
they are necessarily subordinate to the conservation
of Government itself. Grant them or deny them, in
greater or less degree, and you inflict no shock. The
machinery of Government continues to move. The
State does not cease to exist. Far otherwise is it with
the eminent question now before you, involving, as it
does, Liberty in a broad Territory, and also involving
the peace of the whole country, with our good name in
history forevermore.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Take down your map, Sir, and you will find that the
Territory of Kansas, more than any other region, occupies
the middle spot of North America, equally distant
from the Atlantic on the east and the Pacific on the
west, from the frozen waters of Hudson’s Bay on the
north and the tepid Gulf Stream on the south,&mdash;constituting
the precise geographical centre of the whole
vast Continent. To such advantages of situation, on
the very highway between two oceans, are added a so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>il
of unsurpassed richness, and a fascinating, undulating
beauty of surface, with a health-giving climate, calculated
to nurture a powerful and generous people, worthy
to be a central pivot of American institutions. A
few short months have hardly passed since this spacious
mediterranean country was open only to the savage,
who ran wild in its woods and prairies; and now it has
drawn to its bosom a population of freemen larger than
Athens crowded within her historic gates, when her
sons, under Miltiades, won liberty for mankind on the
field of Marathon,&mdash;more than Sparta contained, when
she ruled Greece, and sent forth her devoted children,
quickened by a mother’s benediction, to return with
their shields or on them,&mdash;more than Rome gathered
on her seven hills, when, under her kings, she commenced
that sovereign sway which afterwards embraced
the whole earth,&mdash;more than London held, when, on
the fields of Crécy and Agincourt, the English banner
was borne victorious over the chivalrous hosts of
France.</p>

<p>Against this Territory, thus fortunate in position and
population, a Crime has been committed which is without
example in the records of the Past. Not in plundered
provinces or in the cruelties of selfish governors
will you find its parallel; and yet there is an ancient
instance which may show at least the path of justice.
In the terrible impeachment by which the Roman Orator
has blasted through all time the name of Verres,
charges were, that he had carried away productions of
Art, and had violated the sacred shrines. But, amidst
charges of robbery and sacrilege, the enormity which
most aroused the indignant voice of his accuser, and
which still stands forth with strongest distinctness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>,
arousing the sympathetic indignation of all who read
the story, was, that away in Sicily he had scourged a
citizen of Rome,&mdash;that the cry, “I am a Roman citizen,”
had been interposed in vain against the lash of the
tyrant governor. It was in the presence of the Roman
Senate that this arraignment proceeded,&mdash;in a temple
of the Forum,&mdash;amidst crowds such as no orator had
ever before drawn together, thronging the porticos and
colonnades, even clinging to the house-tops and neighboring
slopes, and under the anxious gaze of witnesses
summoned from the scene of crime. But an audience
grander far, of higher dignity, of more various people,
and of wider intelligence,&mdash;the countless multitude of
succeeding generations, in every land where eloquence
has been studied, or where the Roman name has been
recognized,&mdash;has listened to the accusation, and throbbed
with condemnation of the criminal. Sir, speaking in
an age of light, and in a land of constitutional liberty,
where the safeguards of elections are justly placed among
the highest triumphs of civilization, I fearlessly assert
that the wrongs of much-abused Sicily, thus memorable
in history, were small by the side of the wrongs of Kansas,
where the very shrines of popular institutions, more
sacred than any heathen altar, are desecrated,&mdash;where
the ballot-box, more precious than any work in ivory
or marble from the cunning hand of Art, is plundered,&mdash;and
where the cry, “I am an American citizen,” is
interposed in vain against outrage of every kind, even
upon life itself. Are you against robbery? I hold it
up to your scorn. Are you against sacrilege? I present
it for your execration. Are you for the protection
of American citizens? I show you how their dearest
rights are cloven down, while a Tyrannical Usurpat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>ion
seeks to install itself on their very necks!</p>

<p>The wickedness which I now begin to expose is immeasurably
aggravated by the motive which prompted
it. Not in any common lust for power did this uncommon
tragedy have its origin. It is the rape of a virgin
Territory, compelling it to the hateful embrace of Slavery;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
and it may be clearly traced to a depraved desire
for a new Slave State, hideous offspring of such a crime,
in the hope of adding to the power of Slavery in the
National Government. Yes, Sir, when the whole world,
alike Christian and Turk, is rising up to condemn this
wrong, making it a hissing to the nations, here in our
Republic, <em>force</em>&mdash;ay, Sir, FORCE&mdash;is openly employed
in compelling Kansas to this pollution, and all for the
sake of political power. There is the simple fact, which
you will vainly attempt to deny, but which in itself presents
an essential wickedness that makes other public
crimes seem like public virtues.</p>

<p>This enormity, vast beyond comparison, swells to dimensions
of crime which the imagination toils in vain
to grasp, when it is understood that for this purpose
are hazarded the horrors of intestine feud, not only in
this distant Territory, but everywhere throughout the
country. The muster has begun. The strife is no longer
local, but national. Even now, while I speak, portents
lower in the horizon, threatening to darken the land,
which already palpitates with the mutterings of civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
war. The fury of the propagandists, and the calm determination
of their opponents, are diffused from the
distant Territory over wide-spread communities, and the
whole country, in all its extent, marshalling hostile divisions,
and foreshadowing a conflict which, unless happily
averted by the triumph of Freedom, will become
war,&mdash;fratricidal, parricidal war,&mdash;with an accumulated
wickedness beyond that of any war in human annals,
justly provoking the avenging judgment of Providence
and the avenging pen of History, and constituting a
strife such as was pictured by the Roman historian,
more than <em>foreign</em>, more than <em>social</em>, more than <em>civil</em>,
being something compounded of all these, and in itself
more than war,&mdash;“<em>sed potius commune quoddam ex omnibus,
et plus quam bellum</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such is the Crime which you are to judge. The
criminal also must be dragged into day, that you may
see and measure the power by which all this wrong is
sustained. From no common source could it proceed.
In its perpetration was needed a spirit of vaulting ambition
which would hesitate at nothing; a hardihood of
purpose insensible to the judgment of mankind; a madness
for Slavery, in spite of Constitution, laws, and all
the great examples of our history; also a consciousness
of power such as comes from the habit of power; a combination
of energies found only in a hundred arms directed
by a hundred eyes; a control of Public Opinion
through venal pens and a prostituted press; an ability
to subsidize crowds in every vocation of life,&mdash;the politician
with his local importance, the lawyer with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
subtle tongue, and even the authority of the judge on the
bench,&mdash;with a familiar use of men in places high and
low, so that none, from the President to the lowest border
postmaster, should decline to be its tool: all these
things, and more, were needed, and they were found in
the Slave Power of our Republic. There, Sir, stands the
criminal, all unmasked before you, heartless, grasping,
and tyrannical, with an audacity beyond that of Verres,
a subtlety beyond that of Machiavel, a meanness beyond
that of Bacon, and an ability beyond that of Hastings.
Justice to Kansas can be secured only by the prostration
of this influence: for this is the Power behind&mdash;greater
than any President&mdash;which succors and sustains the
Crime. Nay, the proceedings I now arraign derive their
fearful consequence only from this connection.</p>

<p>In opening this great matter, I am not insensible to
the austere demands of the occasion; but the dependence
of the Crime against Kansas upon the Slave Power
is so peculiar and important that I trust to be pardoned
while I impress it by an illustration which to some may
seem trivial. It is related in Northern Mythology, that
the God of Force, visiting an enchanted region, was
challenged by his royal entertainer to what seemed a
humble feat of strength,&mdash;merely, Sir, to lift a cat from
the ground. The god smiled at the challenge, and,
calmly placing his hand under the belly of the animal,
with superhuman strength strove, while the back of the
feline monster arched far upwards, even beyond reach,
and one paw actually forsook the earth, when at last the
discomfited divinity desisted; but he was little surprised
at his defeat, when he learned that this creature, which
seemed to be a cat, and nothing more, was not merely
a cat, but that it belonged to and was part of the g<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>reat
Terrestrial Serpent which in its innumerable folds encircled
the whole globe. Even so the creature whose
paws are now fastened upon Kansas, whatever it may
seem to be, constitutes in reality part of the Slave Power,
which, with loathsome folds, is now coiled about the
whole land. Thus do I exhibit the extent of the present
contest, where we encounter not merely local resistance,
but also the unconquered sustaining arm behind.
But from the vastness of the Crime attempted,
with all its woe and shame, I derive well-founded assurance
of commensurate effort by the aroused masses of
the country, determined not only to vindicate Right
against Wrong, but to redeem the Republic from the
thraldom of that Oligarchy which prompts, directs, and
concentrates the distant wrong.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such is the Crime and such the criminal which it is
my duty to expose; and, by the blessing of God, this duty
shall be done completely to the end. But this will
not be enough. The Apologies which, with strange hardihood,
are offered for the Crime must be torn away, so
that it shall stand forth without a single rag or fig-leaf to
cover its vileness. And, finally, the True Remedy must
be shown. The subject is complex in relations, as it is
transcendent in importance; and yet, if I am honored
by your attention, I hope to present it clearly in all its
parts, while I conduct you to the inevitable conclusion
that Kansas must be admitted at once, with her present
Constitution, as a State of this Union, and give a
new star to the blue field of our National Flag. And
here I derive satisfaction from the thought, that the
cause is so strong in itself as to bear even the infirmities
of its advocates; nor can it require anything beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
that simplicity of treatment and moderation of manner
which I desire to cultivate. Its true character is such,
that, like Hercules, it will conquer just so soon as it is
recognized.</p>

<p>My task will be divided under three different heads:
<i>first</i>, <span class="smcap">the Crime against Kansas</span>, in its origin and extent;
<i>secondly</i>, <span class="smcap">the Apologies for the Crime</span>; and,
<i>thirdly</i>, <span class="smcap">the True Remedy</span>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before entering upon the argument, I must say something
of a general character, particularly in response to
what has fallen from Senators who have raised themselves
to eminence on this floor in championship of human
wrong: I mean the Senator from South Carolina
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Butler</span>] and the Senator from Illinois [Mr. <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>],
who, though unlike as Don Quixote and Sancho
Panza, yet, like this couple, sally forth together in the
same adventure. I regret much to miss the elder Senator
from his seat; but the cause against which he has
run a tilt, with such ebullition of animosity, demands
that the opportunity of exposing him should not be lost;
and it is for the cause that I speak. The Senator from
South Carolina has read many books of chivalry, and
believes himself a chivalrous knight, with sentiments of
honor and courage. Of course he has chosen a mistress
to whom he has made his vows, and who, though ugly
to others, is always lovely to him,&mdash;though polluted in
the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight: I mean the
harlot Slavery. For her his tongue is always profuse
in words. Let her be impeached in character, or any
proposition be made to shut her out from the extension
of her wantonness, and no extravagance of manner or
hardihood of assertion is then too great for this S<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>enator.
The frenzy of Don Quixote in behalf of his wench Dulcinea
del Toboso is all surpassed. The asserted rights
of Slavery, which shock equality of all kinds, are cloaked
by a fantastic claim of equality. If the Slave States cannot
enjoy what, in mockery of the great fathers of the
Republic, he misnames Equality under the Constitution,&mdash;in
other words, the full power in the National
Territories to compel fellow-men to unpaid toil, to separate
husband and wife, and to sell little children at
the auction-block,&mdash;then, Sir, the chivalric Senator will
conduct the State of South Carolina out of the Union!
Heroic knight! Exalted Senator! A second Moses
come for a second exodus!</p>

<p>Not content with this poor menace, which we have
been twice told was “measured,” the Senator, in the unrestrained
chivalry of his nature, has undertaken to apply
opprobrious words to those who differ from him on this
floor. He calls them “sectional and fanatical”; and
resistance to the Usurpation of Kansas he denounces as
“an uncalculating fanaticism.” To be sure, these charges
lack all grace of originality and all sentiment of truth;
but the adventurous Senator does not hesitate. He is
the uncompromising, unblushing representative on this
floor of a flagrant <em>sectionalism</em>, now domineering over
the Republic,&mdash;and yet, with a ludicrous ignorance of
his own position, unable to see himself as others see him,
or with an effrontery which even his white head ought
not to protect from rebuke, he applies to those here who
resist his <em>sectionalism</em> the very epithet which designates
himself. The men who strive to bring back the Government
to its original policy, when Freedom and not Slavery
was national, while Slavery and not Freedom was
sectional, he arraigns as <em>sectional</em>. Thi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>s will not do. It
involves too great a perversion of terms. I tell that
Senator that it is to himself, and to the “organization”
of which he is the “committed advocate,” that this epithet
belongs. I now fasten it upon them. For myself,
I care little for names; but, since the question is raised
here, I affirm that the Republican party of the Union is
in no just sense <em>sectional</em>, but, more than any other party,
<em>national</em>,&mdash;and that it now goes forth to dislodge from
the high places that tyrannical sectionalism of which
the Senator from South Carolina is one of the maddest
zealots.</p>

<p>To the charge of fanaticism I also reply. Sir, fanaticism
is found in an enthusiasm or exaggeration of
opinion, particularly on religious subjects; but there
may be fanaticism for evil as well as for good. Now I
will not deny that there are persons among us loving
Liberty too well for personal good in a selfish generation.
Such there may be; and, for the sake of their
example, would that there were more! In calling them
“fanatics,” you cast contumely upon the noble army of
martyrs, from the earliest day down to this hour,&mdash;upon
the great tribunes of human rights, by whom life, liberty,
and happiness on earth have been secured,&mdash;upon the
long line of devoted patriots, who, throughout history,
have truly loved their country,&mdash;and upon all who, in
noble aspiration for the general good, and in forgetfulness
of self, have stood out before their age, and gathered
into their generous bosoms the shafts of tyranny and
wrong, in order to make a pathway for Truth;&mdash;you discredit
Luther, when alone he nailed his articles to the
door of the church at Wittenberg, and then to the imperial
demand that he should retract firmly replied,
“Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span> me God!”
you discredit Hampden, when alone he refused to pay
the few shillings of ship money, and shook the throne of
Charles the First; you discredit Milton, when, amidst
the corruptions of a heartless court, he lived on, the lofty
friend of Liberty, above question or suspicion; you discredit
Russell and Sidney, when, for the sake of country,
they calmly turned from family and friends, to tread the
steps of the scaffold; you discredit those early founders
of American institutions, who preferred the hardships of
a wilderness, surrounded by a savage foe, to injustice on
beds of ease; you discredit our later fathers, who, few in
numbers and weak in resources, yet strong in their cause,
did not hesitate to brave the mighty power of England,
already encircling the globe with her morning drumbeats.
Yes, Sir, of such are the fanatics, according to
the Senator. But I tell the Senator that there are characters,
badly eminent, of whose fanaticism there can be
no question. Such were the ancient Egyptians, who
worshipped divinities in brutish forms; the Druids, who
darkened the forests of oak, in which they lived, by sacrifices
of blood; the Mexicans, who surrendered countless
victims to the propitiation of obscene idols; the
Spaniards, who, under Alva, sought to force the Inquisition
upon Holland, by a tyranny kindred to that now
employed to force Slavery upon Kansas; and such were
the Algerines, when, in solemn conclave, after listening
to a speech not unlike that of the Senator from South
Carolina, they resolved to continue the slavery of white
Christians, and to extend it over countrymen of Washington,&mdash;ay,
Sir, extend it! And in this same dreary
catalogue faithful History must record all who now, in
an enlightened age, and in a land of boasted Freedom,
stand up, in perversion of the Constitution, and in d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>enial
of immortal truth, to fasten a new shackle upon their
fellow-man. If the Senator wishes to see fanatics, let
him look round among his own associates,&mdash;let him
look at himself.</p>

<p>But I have not done with the Senator. There is
another matter regarded by him of such consequence
that he interpolated it into the speech of the Senator
from New Hampshire [Mr. <span class="smcap">Hale</span>], and also announced
that he had prepared himself with it, to take in his pocket
all the way to Boston, when he expected to address
the people there.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> On this account, and for the sake of
truth, I stop for one moment and tread it to the earth.
The North, according to the Senator, was engaged in
the slave-trade, and helped to introduce slaves into the
Southern States; and this undeniable fact he proposed
to establish by statistics, in giving which his errors exceeded
his sentences in number. I let these pass for
the present, that I may deal with his argument. Pray,
Sir, is acknowledged turpitude in a departed generation
to become the example for us? And yet the suggestion,
if entitled to any consideration in this discussion,
must have this extent. I join my friend from
New Hampshire in thanking the Senator from South
Carolina for this instance, since it gives me opportunity
to say that the Northern merchants, with homes in
Boston, Bristol, Newport, New York, and Philadelphia,
who catered for Slavery during the years of the slave-trade,
are lineal progenitors of the Northern men, with
homes in these places, who lend themselves to Slavery
in our day,&mdash;and especially that all, whether North
or South, who take part, directly or indirectly, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span> the
conspiracy against Kansas, do but continue the work
of the slave-traders, which you condemn. It is true,
too true, alas! that our fathers were engaged in this
traffic; but that is no apology for it. And in repelling
the authority of this example, I repel also the
trite argument founded on the earlier example of England.
It is true that our mother country, at the Peace
of Utrecht, extorted from Spain the shameful Asiento,
securing the monopoly of the slave-trade with the
Spanish Colonies, as part pay for the blood of great
victories,&mdash;that she higgled at Aix-la-Chapelle for
another lease of this exclusive traffic,&mdash;and again at
the Treaty of Madrid bartered the wretched piracy for
money. It is true that in this spirit the power of the
mother country was prostituted to the same base ends
in her American Colonies, against indignant protests
from our fathers. All these things now rise in judgment
against her. Let us not follow the Senator from
South Carolina to do the very evil which in another
generation we condemn.</p>

<p>As the Senator from South Carolina is the Don Quixote,
so the Senator from Illinois [Mr. <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>] is the
squire of Slavery, its very Sancho Panza, ready to do
its humiliating offices. This Senator, in his labored address
vindicating his labored report,&mdash;piling one mass
of elaborate error upon another mass,&mdash;constrained
himself, as you will remember, to unfamiliar decencies
of speech. Of that address I have nothing to say at
this moment, though before I sit down I shall show
something of its fallacies. But I go back now to an
earlier occasion, when, true to native impulses, he threw
into this discussion, “for a charm of powerful trouble,”
personalities most di<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>screditable to this body. I will
not stop to repel imputations which he cast upon myself;
but I mention them to remind you of the “sweltered
venom sleeping got,” which, with other poisoned
ingredients, he cast into the caldron of this debate. Of
other things I speak. Standing on this floor, the Senator
issued his rescript requiring submission to the
Usurped Power of Kansas; and this was accompanied
by a manner&mdash;all his own&mdash;befitting the tyrannical
threat. Very well. Let the Senator try. I tell him
now that he cannot enforce any such submission. The
Senator, with the Slave Power at his back, is strong; but
he is not strong enough for this purpose. He is bold.
He shrinks from nothing. Like Danton, he may cry, “<em>De
l’audace! encore de l’audace! et toujours de l’audace!</em>”
but even his audacity cannot compass this work. The
Senator copies the British officer who with boastful
swagger said that with the end of his sword he would
cram the “stamps” down the throats of the American
people; and he will meet a similar failure. He may
convulse this country with civil feud. Like the ancient
madman, he may set fire to this Temple of Constitutional
Liberty, grander than Ephesian dome; but he cannot
enforce obedience to that tyrannical Usurpation.</p>

<p>The Senator dreams that he can subdue the North.
He disclaims the open threat, but his conduct implies it.
How little that Senator knows himself, or the strength
of the cause which he persecutes! He is but mortal
man; against him is immortal principle. With finite
power he wrestles with the infinite, and he must fall.
Against him are stronger battalions than any marshalled
by mortal arm,&mdash;the inborn, ineradicable, invincible
sentiments of the human heart; against him is Nature
with all her subtile forces; against him is God. Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
him try to subdue these.</p>

<p>Passing from things which, though touching the very
heart of the discussion, are yet preliminary, I press at
once to the main question.</p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>I undertake, in the first place, to expose the <span class="smcap">Crime
against Kansas</span>, in origin and extent. Logically this
is the beginning of the argument. I say Crime, and deliberately
adopt this strongest term, as better than any
other denoting the consummate transgression. I would
go further, if language could further go. It is the <em>Crime
of Crimes</em>,&mdash;surpassing far the old <em>Crimen Majestatis</em>,
pursued with vengeance by the laws of Rome, and containing
all other crimes, as the greater contains the less.
I do not go too far, when I call it the <em>Crime against
Nature</em>, from which the soul recoils, and which language
refuses to describe. To lay bare this enormity
I now proceed. The whole subject has become a twice-told
tale, and its renewed recital will be a renewal of
sorrow and shame; but I shall not hesitate. The occasion
requires it from the beginning.</p>

<p>It is well remarked by a distinguished historian of
our country, that, “at the Ithuriel touch of the Missouri
discussion, the Slave Interest, hitherto hardly recognized
as a distinct element in our system, started up portentous
and dilated,”<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> with threats and assumptions which
are the origin of our existing national politics. This
was in 1820. The debate ended with the admission of
Missouri as a Slaveholding State, and the prohibition of
Slavery in all the remaining territory west of the Missi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>ssippi
and north of 36° 30´, leaving the condition of
other territory south of this line, or subsequently acquired,
untouched by the arrangement. Here was a
solemn act of legislation, called at the time compromise,
covenant, compact, first brought forward in this
body by a slaveholder, vindicated in debate by slaveholders,
finally sanctioned by slaveholding votes,&mdash;also
upheld at the time by the essential approbation of a
slaveholding President, James Monroe, and his Cabinet,
of whom a majority were slaveholders, including
Mr. Calhoun himself; and this compromise was made
the condition of the admission of Missouri, without
which that State could not have been received into the
Union. The bargain was simple, and was applicable, of
course, only to the territory named. Leaving all other
territory to await the judgment of another generation,
the South said to the North, Conquer your prejudices so
far as to admit Missouri as a Slave State, and, in consideration
of this much coveted boon, Slavery shall be
prohibited “forever” (mark here the word “<em>forever</em>”)<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
in all the remaining Louisiana Territory above 36° 30´;
and the North yielded.</p>

<p>In total disregard of history, the President, in his annual
message, tells us that this compromise “was <em>reluctantly</em>
acquiesced in by Southern States.” Just the
contrary is true. It was the work of slaveholders, and
by their concurring votes was crowded upon a reluctant
North. It was hailed by slaveholders as a victory.
Charles Pinckney, of South Carolina, in an oft quoted
letter, written at eight o’clock on the night of its passage,
says: “It is considered here by the Slaveholding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
States as a great triumph.”<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> At the North it was accepted
as a defeat, and the friends of Freedom everywhere
throughout the country bowed their heads with
mortification. Little did they know the completeness
of their disaster. Little did they dream that the prohibition
of Slavery in the territory, which was stipulated
as the price of their fatal capitulation, would also, at the
very moment of its maturity, be wrested from them.</p>

<p>Time passed, and it became necessary to provide for
this territory an organized government. Suddenly, without
notice in the public press, or the prayer of a single
petition, or one word of open recommendation from
the President, after an acquiescence of thirty-four years,
and the irreclaimable possession by the South of its special
share under this compromise, in breach of every
obligation of honor, compact, and good neighborhood,
and in contemptuous disregard of the outgushing sentiments
of an aroused North, this time-honored Prohibition&mdash;in
itself a Landmark of Freedom&mdash;was overturned,
and the vast region now known as Kansas and
Nebraska was opened to Slavery. It is natural that a
measure thus repugnant in character should be pressed
by arguments mutually repugnant. It was urged on
two principal reasons, so opposite and inconsistent as to
fight with each other: one being, that, by the repeal of
the Prohibition, the Territory would be left open to the
entry of slaveholders with their slaves, without hindrance;
and the other being, that the people would be
left absolutely free to determine the question for themselves,
and to prohibit the entry of slaveholders with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
their slaves, if they should think best. With some the
apology was the alleged rights of slaveholders; with
others it was the alleged rights of the people. With
some it was openly the extension of Slavery; and with
others it was openly the establishment of Freedom, under
the guise of Popular Sovereignty. The measure,
thus upheld in defiance of reason, was carried through
Congress in defiance of all securities of legislation.
These things I mention that you may see in what foulness
the present Crime was engendered.</p>

<p>It was carried, <i>first</i>, by <em>whipping in</em>, through Executive
influence and patronage, men who acted against their
own declared judgment and the known will of their
constituents; <i>secondly</i>, by <em>thrusting out of place</em>, both in
the Senate and House of Representatives, important business,
long pending, and usurping its room; <i>thirdly</i>, by
<em>trampling under foot</em> the rules of the House of Representatives,
always before the safeguard of the minority;
and, <i>fourthly</i>, by <em>driving it to a close</em> during the
very session in which it originated, so that it might not
be arrested by the indignant voice of the People. Such
are some of the means by which this snap judgment was
obtained. If the clear will of the people had not been
disregarded, it could not have passed. If the Government
had not nefariously interposed, it could not have
passed. If it had been left to its natural place in the
order of business, it could not have passed. If the rules
of the House and the rights of the minority had not
been violated, it could not have passed. If it had been
allowed to go over to another Congress, when the People
might be heard, it would have been ended; and
then the Crime we now deplore would have been without
its first seminal life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. President, I mean to keep absolutely within the
limits of parliamentary propriety. I make no personal
imputations, but only with frankness, such as belongs
to the occasion and my own character, describe a great
historical act, now enrolled in the Capitol. Sir, the
Nebraska Bill was in every respect a swindle. It was
a swindle of the North by the South. On the part of
those who had already completely enjoyed their share
of the Missouri Compromise, it was a swindle of those
whose share was yet absolutely untouched; and the
plea of unconstitutionality set up&mdash;like the plea of
usury after the borrowed money has been enjoyed&mdash;did
not make it less a swindle. Urged as a bill of peace,
it was a swindle of the whole country. Urged as opening
the doors to slave-masters with their slaves, it was
a swindle of Popular Sovereignty in its asserted doctrine.
Urged as sanctioning Popular Sovereignty, it was
a swindle of slave-masters in their asserted rights. It
was a swindle of a broad territory, thus cheated of protection
against Slavery. It was a swindle of a great
cause, early espoused by Washington, Franklin, and
Jefferson, surrounded by the best fathers of the Republic.
Sir, it was a swindle of God-given, inalienable
rights. Turn it over, look at it on all sides, and it is
everywhere a swindle; and if the word I now employ
has not the authority of classical usage, it has, on this
occasion, the indubitable authority of fitness. No other
word will adequately express the mingled meanness
and wickedness of the cheat.</p>

<p>Its character is still further apparent in the general
structure of the bill. Amidst overflowing professions
of regard for the sovereignty of the people in the Territory,
they are despoiled of every essential privilege of
sovereignty. They are not allowed to choose Govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>or,
Secretary, Chief Justice, Associate Justices, Attorney,
or Marshal,&mdash;all of whom are sent from Washington;
nor are they allowed to regulate the salaries of any of
these functionaries, or the daily allowance of the legislative
body, or even the pay of the clerks and door-keepers:
but they are left free to adopt Slavery. And
this is nicknamed Popular Sovereignty! Time does
not allow, nor does the occasion require, that I should
stop to dwell on this transparent device to cover a transcendent
wrong. Suffice it to say, that Slavery is in
itself an arrogant denial of human rights, and by no human
reason can the power to establish such a wrong
be placed among the attributes of any just sovereignty.
In refusing it such a place, I do not deny popular
rights, but uphold them, I do not restrain popular rights,
but extend them. And, Sir, to this conclusion you
must yet come, unless deaf, not only to the admonitions
of political justice, but also to the genius of our Constitution,
under which, when properly interpreted, no
valid claim for Slavery can be set up anywhere in the
National territory. The Senator from Michigan [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Cass</span>] may say, in response to the Senator from Mississippi
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>], that Slavery cannot go into the
Territory, under the Constitution, without legislative introduction;
and permit me to add, in response to both,
that Slavery cannot go there at all. <em>Nothing can come
out of nothing</em>; and there is absolutely nothing in the
Constitution out of which Slavery can be derived, while
there are provisions, which, when properly interpreted,
make its existence anywhere within the exclusive National
jurisdiction impossible.</p>

<p>The offensive provision in the bill is in its form a
legislative anomaly, utterly wanting the natural dir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>ectness
and simplicity of an honest transaction. It does
not undertake openly to repeal the old Prohibition of
Slavery, but seems to mince the matter, as if conscious
of the swindle. It says that this Prohibition, “being
inconsistent with the principle of non-intervention by
Congress with Slavery in the States and Territories, as
recognized by the legislation of 1850, commonly called
the Compromise Measures, is hereby declared inoperative
and void.” Thus, with insidious ostentation, is it
pretended that an act violating the greatest compromise
of our legislative history, and loosening the foundations
of all compromise, is derived out of a compromise.
Then follows in the bill the further declaration, entirely
without precedent, which has been aptly called
“a stump speech in its belly,” namely, “it being the
true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate Slavery
into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom,
but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to
form and regulate their domestic institutions in their
own way, subject only to the Constitution of the United
States.”<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Here are smooth words, such as belong to a
cunning tongue enlisted in a bad cause. But whatever
may have been their various hidden meanings, this at
least is evident, that, by their effect, the Congressional
prohibition of Slavery, which had always been regarded
as a seven-fold shield, covering the whole Louisiana
Territory north of 36° 30´, is now removed, while a principle
is declared which renders the supplementary prohibition
of Slavery in Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington
“inoperative and void,” and thus opens to
Slavery all these vast regions, now the r<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>ude cradles of
mighty States. Here you see the magnitude of the
mischief contemplated. But my purpose is with the
Crime against Kansas, and I shall not stop to expose
the conspiracy beyond.</p>

<p>Mr. President, men are wisely presumed to intend the
natural consequences of their conduct, and to seek what
their acts seem to promote. Now the Nebraska Bill,
on its very face, openly clears the way for Slavery, and
it is not wrong to presume that its originators intended
the natural consequences of such an act, and sought in
this way to extend Slavery. Of course they did. And
this is the first stage in the Crime against Kansas.</p>

<p>This was speedily followed by other developments.
It was soon whispered that Kansas must be a Slave
State. In conformity with this barefaced scheme was
the Government of this unhappy Territory organized
in all its departments; and thus did the President, by
whose complicity the Prohibition of Slavery was overthrown,
lend himself to a new complicity,&mdash;giving to
the conspirators a lease of connivance, amounting even
to copartnership. The Governor, Secretary, Chief Justice,
Associate Justices, Attorney, and Marshal, with a
whole caucus of other stipendiaries, nominated by the
President and confirmed by the Senate, are all commended
as friendly to Slavery. No man with the sentiments
of Washington or Jefferson or Franklin finds
favor; nor is it too much to say, that, had these great
patriots once more come among us, not one of them, with
his recorded, unretracted opinions on Slavery, could be
nominated by the President or confirmed by the Senate
for any post in that Territory. With such auspices the
conspiracy proceeded. Even in advance of the Nebraska
Bill, secret societies were organized in Missouri, os<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>tensibly
to protect her institutions, and afterwards, under
the name of “Self-Defensive Associations” and “Blue
Lodges,” these were multiplied throughout the western
counties of that State, <em>before any counter movement from
the North</em>. It was confidently anticipated, that, by the
activity of these societies, and the interest of slaveholders
everywhere, with the advantage derived from the
neighborhood of Missouri and the influence of the Territorial
Government, Slavery might be introduced into
Kansas, quietly, but surely, without arousing conflict,&mdash;that
the crocodile egg might be stealthily dropped in
the sunburnt soil, there to be hatched, unobserved until
it sent forth its reptile monster.</p>

<p>But the conspiracy was unexpectedly balked. The
debate, which convulsed Congress, stirred the whole
country. From all sides attention was directed upon
Kansas, which at once became the favorite goal of emigration.
The bill loudly declares that its object is
“to leave the people perfectly free to form and regulate
their domestic institutions in their own way”; and its
supporters everywhere challenge the determination of
the question between Freedom and Slavery by a competition
of emigration. Thus, while opening the Territory
to Slavery, the bill also opens it to emigrants from
every quarter, who may by votes redress the wrong.
The populous North, stung by sense of outrage, and inspired
by a noble cause, are pouring into the debatable
land, and promise soon to establish a supremacy of
numbers there, involving, of course, a just supremacy
of Freedom.</p>

<p>Then was conceived the consummation of the Crime
against Kansas. What could not be accomplished
peaceably was to be accomplished forcibly. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span> reptile
monster, that could not be quietly and securely hatched
there, is to be pushed full-grown into the Territory. All
efforts are now applied to the dismal work of forcing
Slavery upon Free Soil. In flagrant derogation of the
very Popular Sovereignty whose name helped to impose
this bill upon the country, the atrocious object is distinctly
avowed. And the avowal is followed by the
act. Slavery is forcibly introduced into Kansas, and
placed under formal safeguard of pretended law. How
this is done belongs to the argument.</p>

<p>In depicting this consummation, the simplest outline,
without one word of color, will be best. Whether regarded
in mass or detail, in origin or result, it is all
blackness, illumined by nothing from itself, but only by
the heroism of the undaunted men and women whom it
environed. A plain statement of facts is a picture of
direst truth, which faithful History will preserve in its
darkest gallery. In the foreground all will recognize a
familiar character, in himself connecting link between
President and border ruffian,&mdash;less conspicuous for ability
than for the exalted place he has occupied,&mdash;who
once sat in the seat where you now sit, Sir,&mdash;where
once sat John Adams and Thomas Jefferson,&mdash;also,
where once sat Aaron Burr. I need not add the name
of David R. Atchison.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> You do not forget, that, at
the session of Congress immediately succeeding the
Nebraska Bill, he came tardily to his duty here, and
then, after a short time, disappeared. The secret was
long since disclosed. Like Catiline, he stalked into this
Chamber, reeking with conspiracy,&mdash;<i>immo etiam in Senatum
venit</i>,&mdash;and then, like Catiline, he skulked away,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span><i>abiit,
excessit, evasit, erupit</i>,&mdash;to join and provoke the
conspirators, who at a distance awaited their congenial
chief. Under the influence of his malign presence the
Crime ripened to its fatal fruits, while the similitude
with Catiline is again renewed in the sympathy, not
even concealed, which he finds in the very Senate itself,
where, beyond even the Roman example, a Senator has
not hesitated to appear as his open compurgator.</p>

<p>And now, as I proceed to show the way in which this
Territory was overrun and finally subjugated to Slavery,
I desire to remove, in advance, all question with regard
to the authority on which I rely. The evidence is secondary,
but it is the best which, in the nature of the
case, can be had; and it is not less clear, direct, and peremptory
than any by which we are assured of the campaigns
in the Crimea or the fall of Sebastopol. In its
manifold mass, I confidently assert that it is such a
body of evidence as the human mind is not able to
resist. It is found in the concurring reports of the
public press, in the letters of correspondents, in the
testimony of travellers, and in the unaffected story to
which I have listened from leading citizens, who, during
this winter, have “come flocking” here from that distant
Territory. It breaks forth in the irrepressible outcry,
reaching us from Kansas, whose truthful tones leave no
ground of mistake. It addresses us in formal complaint,
instinct with the indignation of a people determined to
be free, and unimpeachable as the declarations of a
murdered man on his dying-bed against his murderer.
And let me add, that all this testimony finds echo in the
very statute-book of the conspirators, and also in language
dropped from the President of the United States.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>
<p>I begin with an admission from the President himself,
in whose sight the people of Kansas have little
favor. After arraigning the innocent emigrants from
the North, he is constrained to declare that their conduct
is “far from justifying the <em>illegal</em> and <em>reprehensible</em>
counter movements which ensued.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> By the reluctant
admission of the Chief Magistrate, then, there was
a counter movement at once “<em>illegal</em> and <em>reprehensible</em>.”
I thank thee, President, for teaching me these words;
and I now put them in the front of this exposition, as
in themselves a confession. Sir, this “illegal and reprehensible
counter movement” is none other than the
dreadful Crime&mdash;under an apologetic <em>alias</em>&mdash;by which,
through successive invasions, Slavery is forcibly planted
in this Territory.</p>

<p>Next to this Presidential admission must be placed
details of invasions, which I now present as not only
“illegal and reprehensible,” but also unquestionable evidence
of the resulting Crime.</p>

<p>The violence, for some time threatened, broke forth
on the 29th of November, 1854, at the first election of
a Delegate to Congress, when companies from Missouri,
amounting to upwards of one thousand, crossed into
Kansas, and with force and arms proceeded to vote for
General Whitfield, the candidate of Slavery. An eye-witness,
General Pomeroy,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> of superior intelligence and
perfect integrity, thus describes this scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“The first ballot-box that was opened upon our virgin soil
was closed to us by overpowering numbers and impending
force. So bold and reckless were our invaders, that they
cared not to conceal their attack. They came upon us, not
in the guise of voters, to steal away our franchise, but boldly
and openly, to snatch it with a strong hand. They came
directly from their own homes, and in compact and organized
bands, with arms in hand and provisions for the expedition,
marched to our polls, and, when their work was done, returned
whence they came.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here was an outrage at which the coolest blood of
patriotism boils. Though, for various reasons unnecessary
to develop, the busy settlers allowed the election to
pass uncontested, still the means employed were none
the less “illegal and reprehensible.”</p>

<p>This infliction was a significant prelude to the grand
invasion of the 30th of March, 1855, at the election of
the first Territorial Legislature under the organic law,
when an armed multitude from Missouri entered the
Territory in larger numbers than General Taylor commanded
at Buena Vista, or than General Jackson had
within his lines at New Orleans,&mdash;much larger than our
fathers rallied on Bunker Hill. On they came as “an
army with banners,” organized in companies, with officers,
munitions, tents, and provisions, as though marching
upon a foreign foe, and breathing loud-mouthed threats
that they would carry their purpose, if need were, by
the bowie-knife and revolver. Among them, according
to his own confession, was David R. Atchison, belted
with the vulgar arms of his vulgar comrades. Arrived
at their several destinations on the night before the
election, the invaders pitched their tents, placed their
sentries, and waited for the coming day. The same
trustworthy eye-witness whom I have already quoted
says of one locality:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Baggage-wagons were there, with arms and ammunition
enough for a protracted fight, and among them two brass field-pieces,
ready charged. They came with drums beating and
flags flying, and their leaders were of the most prominent
and conspicuous men of their State.”</p>

</div>

<p>Of another locality he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The invaders came together in one armed and organized
body, with trains of fifty wagons, besides horsemen, and the
night before election pitched their camp in the vicinity of
the polls; and having appointed their own judges in place of
those who, from intimidation or otherwise, failed to attend,
they voted without any proof of residence.”</p>

</div>

<p>With this force they were able, on the succeeding day,
in some places, to intimidate the judges of elections, in
others to substitute judges of their own appointment,
in others to wrest the ballot-boxes from their rightful
possessors, and everywhere to exercise a complete control
of the election, and thus, by preternatural audacity
of usurpation, impose a Legislature upon the free people
of Kansas. Thus was conquered the Sebastopol of that
Territory!</p>

<p>It was not enough to secure the Legislature. The
election of a member of Congress recurred on the 1st of
October, 1855, and the same foreigners, who had learned
their strength, again manifested it. Another invasion, in
controlling numbers, came from Missouri, and once more
forcibly exercised the electoral franchise in Kansas.</p>

<p>At last, in the latter days of November, 1855, a storm,
long gathering, burst upon the heads of the devoted
people. The ballot-boxes had been violated, and a
Legislature installed, which proceeded to carry out the
conspiracy of the invaders; but the good people of the
Territory, born to Freedom, and educated as American
citizens, showed no signs of submission. Slavery, th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>ough
recognized by pretended law, was in many places practically
an outlaw. To the lawless borderers this was
hard to bear; and, like the heathen of old, they raged,
particularly against the town of Lawrence, already
known, by the firmness of its principles and the character
of its citizens, as citadel of the good cause. On
this account they threatened, in their peculiar language,
to “wipe it out.” Soon the hostile power was gathered
for this purpose. The wickedness of this invasion was
enhanced by the way in which it began. A citizen of
Kansas, by the name of Dow, was murdered by a partisan
of Slavery, in the name of “law and order.” Such
an outrage naturally aroused indignation and provoked
threats. The professors of “law and order” allowed the
murderer to escape, and, still further to illustrate the
irony of the name they assumed, seized the friend of
the murdered man, whose few neighbors soon rallied for
his rescue. This transaction, though totally disregarded
in its chief front of wickedness, became the excuse for
unprecedented excitement. The weak Governor,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> with
no faculty higher than servility to Slavery,&mdash;whom
the President, in official delinquency, had appointed to
a trust worthy only of a well-balanced character,&mdash;was
frightened from his propriety. By proclamation
he invoked the Territory. By telegraph he invoked
the President. The Territory would not respond to
his senseless appeal. The President was false. But
the proclamation was circulated throughout the border
counties of Missouri; and Platte, Clay, Carroll, Saline,
Howard, and Jackson, each of them, contributed a
volunteer company, recruited from the roadsides, and
armed with weapons which chance afforded, known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
as “the shot-gun militia,”&mdash;with a Missouri officer
as commissary-general, dispensing rations, and another
Missouri officer as general-in-chief,&mdash;with two wagon-loads
of rifles, belonging to Missouri, drawn by six mules,
from its arsenal at Jefferson City,&mdash;with seven pieces of
cannon, belonging to the United States, from its arsenal
at Liberty; and this formidable force, amounting to at
least 1,800 men, terrible with threats, oaths, and whiskey,
crossed the borders, and encamped in larger part on the
Wakarusa, over against the doomed town of Lawrence,
now threatened with destruction. With these invaders
was the Governor, who by this act levied war upon the
people he was sent to protect. In camp with him was
the original Catiline of the conspiracy, while by his side
were the docile Chief Justice and the docile Judges.
But this is not the first instance in which an unjust
governor has found tools where he ought to have found
justice. In the great impeachment of Warren Hastings,
the British orator by whom it was conducted exclaims,
in words strictly applicable to the misdeed I here denounce:
“Had he not the Chief Justice, the tamed and
domesticated Chief Justice, who waited on him like a
familiar spirit?”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Thus was this invasion countenanced
by those who should have stood in the breach against it.
For more than a week it continued, while deadly conflict
was imminent. I do not dwell on the heroism by which
it was encountered, or the mean retreat to which it was
compelled; for that is not necessary in exhibiting the
Crime which you are to judge. But I cannot forbear
to add other features, furnished in a letter written at
the time by a clergyman, who saw and was part of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
he describes.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Our citizens have been shot at, <em>and in two instances
murdered</em>, our houses invaded, hay-ricks burnt, corn and other
provisions plundered, cattle driven off, all communication
cut off between us and the States, wagons on the way to
us with provisions stopped and plundered, and the drivers
taken prisoners, and we in hourly expectation of an attack.
<em>Nearly every man has been in arms in the village.</em> Fortifications
have been thrown up, by incessant labor night and day.
The sound of the drum and the tramp of armed men resounded
through our streets, <em>families fleeing with their household
goods for safety</em>. Day before yesterday the report of
cannon was heard at our house, from the direction of Lecompton.
Last Thursday one of our neighbors,&mdash;one of
the most peaceable and excellent of men, from Ohio,&mdash;on
his way home, was set upon by a gang of twelve men on
horseback, and shot down. Over eight hundred men are
gathered under arms at Lawrence. As yet no act of violence
has been perpetrated by those on our side. <em>No blood
of retaliation stains our hands. We stand, and are ready to
act, purely in the defence of our homes and lives.</em>”</p>

</div>

<p>The catalogue is not yet complete. On the 15th of
December, when the people assembled to vote on the
Constitution submitted for adoption, only a few days
after the Treaty of Peace between the Governor on the
one side and the town of Lawrence on the other, another
and fifth irruption was made. But I leave all this
untold. Enough of these details has been given.</p>

<p>Five several times and more have these invaders entered
Kansas in armed array, and thus five several times
and more have they trampled upon the organic law of
the Territory. These extraordinary expeditions are simply
the extraordinary witnesses to successive, uninterrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
violence. They stand out conspicuous, but not
alone. The spirit of evil, in which they had their origin,
is wakeful and incessant. From the beginning it hung
upon the skirts of this interesting Territory, harrowing
its peace, disturbing its prosperity, and keeping its inhabitants
under the painful alarms of war. All security
of person, property, and labor was overthrown; and when
I urge this incontrovertible fact, I set forth a wrong
which is small only by the side of the giant wrong for
the consummation of which all this is done. Sir, what
is man, what is government, without security, in the
absence of which nor man nor government can proceed
in development or enjoy the fruits of existence? Without
security civilization is cramped and dwarfed. Without
security there is no true Freedom. Nor shall I
say too much, when I declare that security, guarded of
course by its parent Freedom, is the true end and aim
of government. Of this indispensable boon the people
of Kansas are despoiled,&mdash;absolutely, totally. All this
is aggravated by the nature of their pursuits, rendering
them peculiarly sensitive to interruption, and at the same
time attesting their innocence. They are for the most
part engaged in the cultivation of the soil, which from
time immemorial has been the sweet employment of undisturbed
industry. Contented in the returns of bounteous
Nature and the shade of his own trees, the husbandman
is not aggressive; accustomed to produce, and
not to destroy, he is essentially peaceful, unless his home
is invaded, when his arm derives vigor from the soil he
treads, and his soul inspiration from the heavens beneath
whose canopy he daily toils. Such are the people of
Kansas, whose security has been overthrown. Scenes
from which Civilization averts her countenance are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span> part
of their daily life. Border incursions, which in barbarous
ages or barbarous lands fretted and harried an
exposed people, are here renewed, with this peculiarity,
that our border robbers do not simply levy blackmail
and drive off a few cattle, like those who acted under
the inspiration of the Douglas of other days,&mdash;they
do not seize a few persons, and sweep them away into
captivity, like the African slave-traders, whom we brand
as pirates,&mdash;but they commit a succession of deeds in
which border sorrows and African wrongs are revived
together on American soil, while, for the time being, all
protection is annulled, and the whole Territory is enslaved.</p>

<p>Private griefs mingle their poignancy with public
wrongs. I do not dwell on the anxieties of families
exposed to sudden assault, and lying down to rest with
the alarms of war ringing in the ears, not knowing that
another day may be spared to them. Throughout this
bitter winter, with the thermometer at thirty degrees
below zero, the citizens of Lawrence were constrained
to sleep under arms, with sentinels pacing constant
watch against surprise. Our souls are wrung by individual
instances. In vain do we condemn the cruelties
of another age, the refinements of torture to which men
were doomed, the rack and thumb-screw of the Inquisition,
the last agonies of the regicide Ravaillac,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Luke’s iron crown, and Damien’s bed of steel”;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">for kindred outrages disgrace these borders. Murder
stalks, Assassination skulks in the tall grass of the prairie,
and the vindictiveness of man assumes unwonted
forms. A preacher of the Gospel has been ridden on
a rail, then thrown into the Missouri, fastened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span> a log,
and left to drift down its muddy, tortuous current. And
lately we have the tidings of that enormity without precedent,
a deed without a name, where a candidate for the
Legislature was most brutally gashed with knives and
hatchets, and then, after weltering in blood on the snow-clad
earth, trundled along, with gaping wounds, to fall
dead before the face of his wife. It is common to drop
a tear of sympathy over the sorrows of our early fathers,
exposed to the stealthy assault of the savage foe,&mdash;and
an eminent American artist<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> has pictured this scene in
a marble group, on the front of the National Capitol,
where the uplifted tomahawk is arrested by the strong
arm and generous countenance of the pioneer, whose
wife and children find shelter at his feet; but now the
tear must be dropped over the sorrows of fellow-citizens
building a new State in Kansas, and exposed to the
perpetual assault of murderous robbers from Missouri.

who, avowing that murder is their religion, waylay

and the more deadly revolver for the noose of

<p>In these invasions, with the entire subversion of all
security in this Territory, the plunder of the ballot-box,
and the pollution of the electoral franchise, I show simply
the process in unprecedented Crime. If that be the
best government where injury to a single citizen is resented
as injury to the whole State, what must be the
character of a government which leaves a whole community
of citizens thus exposed? In the outrage upon the
ballot-box, even without the illicit fruits which I shall
soon exhibit, there is a peculiar crime, of the deepest dye,
though subordinate to the final Crime, which should be
promptly avenged. In other lands, where royalty is
upheld, it is a special offence to rob the crown jewels,
which are emblems of that sovereignty before which
the loyal subject bows, and it is treason to be found in
adultery with the queen, for in this way may a false
heir be imposed upon the State; but in our Republic
the ballot-box is the single priceless jewel of that sovereignty
which we respect, and the electoral franchise,
where are born the rulers of a free people, is the royal
bed we are to guard against pollution. In this plain
presentment, whether as regards security or as regards
elections, there is enough, without proceeding further,
to justify the intervention of Congress, promptly and
completely, to throw over this oppressed people the impenetrable
shield of the Constitution and laws. But the
half is not yet told.</p>

<p>As every point in a wide-spread horizon radiates from
a common centre, so everything said or done in this vast
circle of Crime radiates from the <em>One Idea</em>, that Kansas,
at all hazards, must be made a Slave State. In all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
manifold wickednesses that occur, and in every successive
invasion, this <em>One Idea</em>, is ever present, as Satanic
tempter, motive power, <em>causing cause</em>. Talk of “one
idea!” Here it is with a vengeance!</p>

<p>To accomplish this result, three things are attempted:
<i>first</i>, by outrage of all kinds, to drive the friends of
Freedom out of the Territory; <i>secondly</i>, to deter others
from coming; and, <i>thirdly</i>, to obtain complete control
of the Government. The process of driving out, and
also of deterring, has failed. On the contrary, the
friends of Freedom there have become more fixed in
resolve to stay and fight the battle which they never
sought, but from which they disdain to retreat,&mdash;while
the friends of Freedom elsewhere are more aroused to
the duty of timely succor by men and munitions of just
self-defence.</p>

<p>While defeated in the first two processes, the conspirators
succeeded in the last. By the violence already
portrayed at the election of the 30th of March, when the
polls were occupied by armed hordes from Missouri, they
imposed a Legislature upon the Territory, and thus, under
the iron mask of law, established a Usurpation not
less complete than any in history. That this was done
I proceed to prove. Here is the evidence.</p>

<p>1. Only in this way can this extraordinary expedition
be adequately explained. In the words of Molière, once
employed by John Quincy Adams in the other House,
“<em>Que diable allaient-ils faire dans cette galère?</em>” What
did they go into the Territory for? If their purposes
were peaceful, as has been suggested, why cannons,
arms, flags, numbers, and all this violence? As simple
citizens, proceeding to the honest exercise of the electoral
franchise, they might go with nothing more than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
pilgrim’s staff. Philosophy always seeks a <em>sufficient
cause</em>, and only in the <em>One Idea</em> already presented can
a cause be found in any degree commensurate with the
Crime; and this becomes so only when we consider the
mad fanaticism of Slavery.</p>

<p>2. Public notoriety steps forward to confirm the suggestion
of reason. In every place where Truth can freely
travel it is asserted and understood that the Legislature
was imposed upon Kansas by foreigners from Missouri;
and this universal voice is now received as undeniable
verity.</p>

<p>3. It is also attested by harangues of the conspirators.
Here is what Stringfellow said <em>before</em> the invasion.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To those who have qualms of conscience as to violating
laws, State or National, the time has come when such impositions
must be disregarded, as your rights and property are
in danger; <em>and I advise you, one and all, to enter every election
district in Kansas, in defiance of Reeder and his vile myrmidons,
and vote at the point of the bowie-knife and revolver</em>.
Neither give nor take quarter, as our cause demands it. It
is enough that the slaveholding interest wills it, from which
there is no appeal. What right has Governor Reeder to
rule Missourians in Kansas? His proclamation and prescribed
oath must be repudiated. It is your interest to
do so. Mind that Slavery is established where it is not prohibited.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here is what Atchison said <em>after</em> the invasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“Well, what next? Why, an election for members of the
Legislature to organize the Territory must be held. What
did I advise you to do then? Why, meet them on their own
ground, and beat them at their own game again; and cold
and inclement as the weather was, I went over with a company
of men. My object in going was not to vote. I had
no right to vote, unless I had disfranchised myself in Missouri.
I was not within two miles of a voting-place. My
object in going was not to vote, but to settle a difficulty
between two of our candidates; and the Abolitionists of the
North said, <em>and published it abroad, that Atchison was there
with bowie-knife and revolver,&mdash;and, by God, ’twas true! I
never did go into that Territory, I never intend to go into that
Territory, without being prepared for all such kind of cattle.</em>
Well, we beat them, and Governor Reeder gave certificates
to a majority of all the members of both Houses, and then,
after they were organized, as everybody will admit, they
were the only competent persons to say who were and who
were not members of the same.”</p>

</div>

<p>4. It is confirmed by contemporaneous admission of
“The Squatter Sovereign,” a paper published at Atchison,
and at once the organ of the President and of these
Borderers, which, under date of 1st April, thus recounts
the victory.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Independence</span>, [<span class="smcap">Missouri</span>,] March 31, 1855.</p>

<p>“Several hundred emigrants from Kansas have just entered
our city. They were preceded by the Westport and
Independence brass bands. They came in at the west side
of the public square, and proceeded entirely around it, the
bands cheering us with fine music, and the emigrants with
good news. Immediately following the bands were about
two hundred horsemen in regular order; following these
were one hundred and fifty wagons, carriages, &amp;c. They
gave repeated cheers for Kansas and Missouri. They report
that not an Antislavery man will be in the Legislature of
Kansas. <em>We have made a clean sweep.</em>”</p>

</div>

<p>5. It is also confirmed by contemporaneous testimony
of another paper, always faithful to Slavery, the
“New York Herald,” in the letter of a correspondent
from Brunswick, Missouri, under date of 20th April,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
1855.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“From five to seven thousand men started from Missouri
to attend the election, some to remove, but the most to return
to their families, with an intention, if they liked the
Territory, to make it their permanent abode at the earliest
moment practicable. But they intended to vote. The
Missourians were, many of them, Douglas men. There
were one hundred and fifty voters from this county, one
hundred and seventy-five from Howard, one hundred from
Cooper. Indeed, every county furnished its quota; and
when they set out, it looked like an army.&hellip; They were
armed.&hellip; And, as there were no houses in the Territory,
they carried tents. Their mission was a peaceable one,&mdash;to
vote, and to drive down stakes for their future homes. After
the election some fifteen hundred of the voters sent a committee
to Mr. Reeder to ascertain if it was his purpose to
ratify the election. He answered that it was, and said the
majority at an election must carry the day. But it is not
to be denied that the fifteen hundred, apprehending that
the Governor might attempt to play the tyrant,&mdash;since his
conduct had already been insidious and unjust,&mdash;wore on
their hats bunches of hemp. They were resolved, if a tyrant
attempted to trample upon the rights of the sovereign
people, to hang him.”</p>

</div>

<p>6. It is again confirmed by testimony of a lady for
five years resident in Western Missouri, who thus
writes in a letter published in the “New Haven Register.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Miami, Saline County</span>, November 26, 1855.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>

<p>“You ask me to tell you something about the Kansas and
Missouri troubles. Of course you know in what they have
originated. <em>There is no denying that the Missourians have
determined to control the elections, if possible</em>; and I do not
know that their measures would be justifiable, except upon
the principle of self-preservation; and that, you know, is
the first law of Nature.”</p>

</div>

<p>7. And it is confirmed still further by the Circular
of the Emigration Society of Lafayette County, in Missouri,
dated as late as 25th March, 1856, where the
efforts of Missourians are openly confessed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The western counties of Missouri have for the last two
years been heavily taxed, both in money and time, in fighting
the battles of the South. <em>Lafayette County alone has expended
more than one hundred thousand dollars in money, and
as much or more in time. Up to this time the border counties
of Missouri have upheld and maintained the rights and interests
of the South in this struggle, unassisted, and not unsuccessfully.</em>
But the Abolitionists, staking their all upon
the Kansas issue, and hesitating at no means, fair or foul,
are moving heaven and earth to render that beautiful Territory
<em>a Free State</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>8. Here, also, is amplest testimony to the Usurpation,
by the “Intelligencer,” a leading paper of St. Louis,
Missouri, made in the ensuing summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“Atchison and Stringfellow, with their Missouri followers,
overwhelmed the settlers in Kansas, browbeat and bullied
them, and took the Government from their hands. Missouri
votes elected the present body of men, who insult public
intelligence and popular rights by styling themselves ‘the
Legislature of Kansas.’ This body of men are helping themselves
to fat speculations by locating the ‘seat of Government’
and getting town lots for their votes. They are passing
laws disfranchising all the citizens of Kansas who do not
believe Negro Slavery to be a Christian institution and a
national blessing. They are proposing to punish with imprisonment
the utterance of views inconsistent with their
own. And they are trying to perpetuate their preposterous
and infernal tyranny by appointing <em>for a term of years</em> creatures
of their own, as commissioners in every county, to lay
and collect taxes, and see that the laws they are passing are
faithfully executed. Has this age anything to compare with
these acts in audacity?”</p>

</div>

<p>9. In harmony with all these is the authoritative declaration
of Governor Reeder, in a speech to his neighbors
at Easton, Pennsylvania, at the end of April, 1855,
and immediately afterwards published in the Washington
“Union.” Here it is.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was, indeed, too true that Kansas had been invaded,
conquered, subjugated, by an armed force from beyond her
borders, led on by a fanatical spirit, trampling under foot the
principles of the Kansas Bill and the right of suffrage.”</p>

</div>

<p>10. In similar harmony is the complaint of the people
of Kansas, in public meeting at Big Springs, on the 5th
of September, 1855, embodied in these words.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the body of men who for the last two
months have been passing laws for the people of our Territory,
moved, counselled, and dictated to by the demagogues
of Missouri, are to us a foreign body, representing only the
lawless invaders who elected them, and not the people of the
Territory,&mdash;that we repudiate their action, as the monstrous
consummation of an act of violence, usurpation, and fraud,
unparalleled in the history of the Union, and worthy only of
men unfitted for the duties and regardless of the responsibilities
of Republicans.”</p>

</div>

<p>11. Finally, the invasion which ended in the Usurpation
is clearly established from official Minutes laid
on our table by the President. But the effect of this
testimony has been so amply exposed by the Senator
from Vermont [Mr. <span class="smcap">Collamer</span>], in his able <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>and indefatigable
argument, that I content myself with simply
referring to it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On this cumulative, irresistible evidence, in concurrence
with antecedent history, I rest. And yet Senators
here argue that this cannot be,&mdash;precisely as the conspiracy
of Catiline was doubted in the Roman Senate.
“<em>Nonnulli sunt in hoc ordine, qui aut ea quæ imminent
non videant, aut ea quæ vident dissimulent; qui spem
Catilinæ mollibus sententiis aluerunt, conjurationemque
nascentem non credendo corroboraverunt.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> These words
of the Roman Orator picture the case here. As I listened
to the Senator from Illinois, while he painfully
strove to show that there is no Usurpation, I was reminded
of the effort by a distinguished logician to prove
that Napoleon Bonaparte never existed. And permit
me to say, that the fact of his existence is not more
entirely above doubt than the fact of this Usurpation.
This I assert on proofs already presented. But confirmation
comes almost while I speak. The columns of
the public press are daily filled with testimony solemnly
taken before the Committee of Congress in Kansas,
which attests, in awful light, the violence ending in
the Usurpation. Of this I may speak on some other
occasion.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Meanwhile I proceed with the development
of the Crime.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The usurping Legislature assembled at the appointed
place in the interior, and then at once, in opposition to
the veto of the Governor, by a majority of two thirds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
removed to the Shawnee Mission, a place in most convenient
proximity to the Missouri borderers, by whom
it had been constituted, and whose tyrannical agent it
was. The statutes of Missouri, in all their text, with
their divisions and subdivisions, were adopted bodily,
and with such little local adaptation that the word
“State” in the original is not even changed to “Territory,”
but is left to be corrected by an explanatory act.
All this general legislation was entirely subordinate to
the special chapter entitled “An Act to punish Offences
against Slave Property,” where the One Idea that provoked
this whole conspiracy is at last embodied in legislative
form, and Human Slavery openly recognized on
Free Soil, under the sanction of pretended law.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> This
chapter, of thirteen sections, is in itself a <em>Dance of Death</em>.
But its complex completeness of wickedness without
parallel may be partially conceived, when it is understood
that in three sections only is the penalty of death
denounced no less than forty-eight different times, by as
many changes of language, against the heinous offence,
described in forty-eight different ways, of interfering
with what does not exist in that Territory, and under
the Constitution cannot exist there,&mdash;I mean property
in human flesh. Thus is Liberty sacrificed to Slavery,
and Death summoned to sit at the gates as guardian
of the Wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>The work of Usurpation was not perfected even yet.
It had already cost too much to be left at any hazard.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent6">“To be thus is nothing,</div>
<div class="verse">But to be safely thus.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such was the object. And this could not be, except by
the entire prostration of all the safeguards of Human
Rights. Liberty of speech, which is the very breath of
a Republic,&mdash;the press, which is the terror of wrong-doers,&mdash;the
bar, through which the oppressed beards
the arrogance of law,&mdash;the jury, by which right is vindicated,&mdash;all
these must be struck down, while officers
are provided in all places, ready to be the tools of this
Tyranny; and then, to obtain final assurance that their
crime is secure, the whole Usurpation, stretching over
the Territory, must be fastened and riveted by legislative
bolt, spike, and screw, <em>so as to defy all effort at
change through ordinary forms of law</em>. To this work,
in its various parts, were bent the subtlest energies;
and never, from Tubal Cain to this hour, was any fabric
forged with more desperate skill and completeness.</p>

<p>Mark, Sir, three different legislative enactments, constituting
part of this work. <i>First</i>, according to one act,
all who deny, by spoken or written word, “the right of
persons to hold slaves in this Territory,” are denounced
as felons, to be punished by imprisonment at hard labor
for a term not less than two years,&mdash;it may be for life.
To show the extravagance of this injustice, it is well
put by the Senator from Vermont [Mr. <span class="smcap">Collamer</span>], that,
should the Senator from Michigan [Mr. <span class="smcap">Cass</span>], who believes
that Slavery cannot exist in a Territory, unless introduced
by express legislative act, venture there with
his moderate opinions, his doom must be that of a felon!
To such extent are the great liberties of speech and of
the press subverted! <i>Secondly</i>, by another act, e<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>ntitled
“An Act concerning Attorneys-at-Law,” no person can
practise as attorney, unless he <em>shall obtain a license</em> from
the Territorial courts, which, of course, a tyrannical discretion
will be free to deny; and after obtaining such
license, he is constrained to take an oath not only “to
support” the Constitution of the United States, but also
“to support and sustain”&mdash;mark here the reduplication&mdash;the
Territorial Act and the Fugitive Slave Bill: thus
erecting a test for admission to the bar, calculated to exclude
citizens who honestly regard the latter legislative
enormity as unfit to be obeyed. And, <i>thirdly</i>, by another
act, entitled “An Act concerning Jurors,” all persons
“conscientiously opposed to the holding slaves,” or
“who do not admit the right to hold slaves in this Territory,”
are excluded from the jury on every question,
civil or criminal, arising out of asserted slave property,&mdash;while,
in all cases, the summoning of the jury is left,
without one word of restraint, to “the marshal, sheriff,
or other officer,” who is thus free to pack it according
to his tyrannical discretion.</p>

<p>For the ready enforcement of all statutes against Human
Freedom, the President furnished a powerful quota
of officers, in the Governor, Chief Justice, Judges, Secretary,
Attorney, and Marshal. The Legislature completed
this part of the work, by constituting in each
county a Board of Commissioners, composed of two
persons, associated with the Probate Judge, whose duty
it is to “appoint a county treasurer, coroner, justices of
the peace, constables, and <em>all</em> other officers provided for
by law,” and then proceeding to the choice of this very
Board: thus delegating and diffusing their usurped
power, and tyrannically imposing upon the Territory a
crowd of officers, in whose appointment the people ha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>d
no voice, directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>And still the final, inexorable work remained to be
done. A Legislature renovated in both branches could
not assemble until 1858: so that, during this long intermediate
period, this whole system must continue in
the likeness of law, unless overturned by the National
Government, or, in default of such interposition, by the
generous uprising of an oppressed people. But it was
necessary to guard against possibility of change, even
tardily, at a future election; and this was done by two
different acts, under the <em>first</em> of which all who do not
take the oath to support the Fugitive Slave Bill are excluded
from the elective franchise, and under the <em>second</em>
of which all others are entitled to vote who tender a
tax of one dollar to the sheriff on the day of election;
thus, by provision of Territorial law, disfranchising all
opposed to Slavery, and at the same time opening the
door to the votes of the invaders; by an unconstitutional
shibboleth excluding from the polls the body of actual
settlers, and by making the franchise depend upon a
petty tax only admitting to the polls the mass of borderers
from Missouri. By tyrannical forethought, the
Usurpation not only fortified all that it did, but assumed
a <em>self-perpetuating</em> energy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus was the Crime consummated. Slavery stands
erect, clanking its chains on the Territory of Kansas,
surrounded by a code of death, and trampling upon all
cherished liberties, whether of speech, the press, the bar,
the trial by jury, or the electoral franchise. And, Sir,
all this is done, not merely to introduce a wrong which
in itself is a denial of all rights, and in dread of which
mothers have taken the lives of their offspring,&mdash;not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
merely, as is sometimes said, to protect Slavery in Missouri,
since it is futile for this State to complain of
Freedom on the side of Kansas, when Freedom exists
without complaint on the side of Iowa, and also on the
side of Illinois,&mdash;but it is done for the sake of political
power, in order to bring two new slaveholding Senators
upon this floor, and thus to fortify in the National
Government the desperate chances of a waning Oligarchy.
As the gallant ship, voyaging on pleasant summer
seas, is assailed by a pirate crew, and plundered of
its doubloons and dollars, so is this beautiful Territory
now assailed in peace and prosperity, and robbed of its
political power for the sake of Slavery. Even now the
black flag of the land pirates from Missouri waves at
the mast-head; in their laws you hear the pirate yell
and see the flash of the pirate knife; while, incredible
to relate, the President, gathering the Slave Power at
his back, testifies a pirate sympathy.</p>

<p>Sir, all this was done in the name of Popular Sovereignty.
And this is the close of the tragedy. Popular
Sovereignty, which, when truly understood, is a fountain
of just power, has ended in Popular Slavery,&mdash;not in the
subjection of the unhappy African race merely, but of
this proud Caucasian blood which you boast. The profession
with which you began, of <em>All by the People</em>, is
lost in the wretched reality of <em>Nothing for the People</em>.
Popular Sovereignty, in whose deceitful name plighted
faith was broken and an ancient Landmark of Freedom
overturned, now lifts itself before us like Sin in the
terrible picture of Milton, which</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent2">“seemed woman to the waist, and fair,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>But ended foul in many a scaly fold</div>
<div class="verse">Voluminous and vast, a serpent armed</div>
<div class="verse">With mortal sting: about her middle round</div>
<div class="verse">A cry of hell-hounds never ceasing barked</div>
<div class="verse">With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung</div>
<div class="verse">A hideous peal; yet, when they list, would creep,</div>
<div class="verse">If aught disturbed their noise, into her womb,</div>
<div class="verse">And kennel there, yet there still barked and howled</div>
<div class="verse">Within, unseen.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The image is complete at all points; and with this exposure
I take my leave of the Crime against Kansas.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Emerging from all the blackness of this Crime, where
we seem to have been lost, as in a savage wood, and
turning our backs upon it, as upon desolation and
death, from which, while others have suffered, we have
escaped, I come now to <span class="smcap">the Apologies</span> which the Crime
has found. Sir, well may you start at the suggestion,
that such a series of wrongs, so clearly proved by various
testimony, so openly confessed by the wrong-doers,
and so widely recognized throughout the country, should
find apologists. But partisan spirit, now, as in other
days, hesitates at nothing. Great crimes of history
have never been without apologies. The massacre of
St. Bartholomew, which you now instinctively condemn,
was at the time applauded in high quarters, and even
commemorated by a Papal medal, which may still be
procured at Rome,&mdash;as the Crime against Kansas, which
is hardly less conspicuous in dreadful eminence, has
been shielded on this floor by extenuating words, and
even by a Presidential message, which, like the Papal
medal, can never be forgotten in considering the perversity
of men.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>
<p>Sir, the Crime cannot be denied. The President himself
has admitted “illegal and reprehensible” conduct.
To such conclusion he was compelled by irresistible
evidence. But what he mildly describes I openly denounce.
Senators may affect to put it aside by sneer,
or to reason it away by figures, or to explain it by
theory, such as desperate invention has produced on this
floor, that the Assassins and Thugs of Missouri are in
reality citizens of Kansas; but all these efforts, so far
as made, are only tokens of weakness, while to the original
Crime they add another offence of false testimony
against innocent and suffering men. But the Apologies
for the Crime are worse than the efforts at denial. In
essential heartlessness they identify their authors with
the great iniquity.</p>

<p>They are four in number, and fourfold in character.
The first is the <em>Apology tyrannical</em>; the second, the
<em>Apology imbecile</em>; the third, the <em>Apology absurd</em>; and
the fourth, the <em>Apology infamous</em>. This is all. Tyranny,
imbecility, absurdity, and infamy all unite to dance,
like the weird sisters, about this Crime.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <em>Apology tyrannical</em> is founded on the mistaken
act of Governor Reeder, in authenticating the Usurping
Legislature, by which it is asserted, that, whatever may
have been the actual force or fraud in its election, the
people of Kansas are effectually concluded, and the
whole proceeding is placed under formal sanction of
law. According to this assumption, complaint is now
in vain, and it only remains that Congress should sit
and hearken to it, without correcting the wrong, as
the ancient tyrant listened and granted no redress to
the human moans that issued from the heated brazen
bull which subtile cruelty had devised. This I cal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>l the
Apology of technicality inspired by tyranny.</p>

<p>The facts on this head are few and plain. Governor
Reeder, after allowing only five days for objections to
the returns,&mdash;a space of time unreasonably brief in
that extensive Territory,&mdash;declared a majority of the
members of the Council and of the House of Representatives
“duly elected,” withheld certificates from certain
others, because of satisfactory proof that they were
not duly elected, and appointed a day for new elections
to supply these vacancies. Afterwards, by formal
message, he recognized the Legislature as a legal body,
and when he vetoed their act of adjournment to the
neighborhood of Missouri, he did it simply on the
ground of illegality in such adjournment under the organic
law. Now to every assumption founded on these
facts there are two satisfactory replies: <i>first</i>, that no
certificate of the Governor can do more than authenticate
a subsisting legal act, without of itself infusing
legality where the essence of legality is not already;
and, <i>secondly</i>, that violence or fraud, wherever disclosed,
vitiates completely every proceeding. In denying these
principles, you place the certificate above the thing certified,
and give a perpetual lease to violence and fraud,
merely because at an ephemeral moment they are unquestioned.
This will not do.</p>

<p>Sir, I am no apologist for Governor Reeder. There
is sad reason to believe that he went to Kansas originally
as tool of the President; but his simple nature,
nurtured in the atmosphere of Pennsylvania, revolted at
the service required, and he turned from his patron to
duty. Grievously did he err in yielding to the Legislature
any act of authentication; but in some measure he
has answered for this error by determined effort <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>since
to expose the utter illegality of that body, which he
now repudiates entirely. It was said of certain Roman
Emperors, who did infinite mischief in their beginnings
and infinite good towards their end, that they
should never have been born or never died; and I
would apply the same to the official life of this Kansas
Governor. At all events, I dismiss the Apology founded
on his acts, as the utterance of Tyranny by the voice of
Law, transcending the declaration of the pedantic judge,
in the British Parliament, on the eve of our Revolution,
that our fathers, notwithstanding their complaints, were
in reality represented in Parliament, inasmuch as their
lands, under the original charters, were held “in common
socage, as of the manor of East Greenwich in
Kent,” which, being duly represented, carried with it
all the Colonies.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Thus in another age has Tyranny assumed
the voice of Law.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next comes the <em>Apology imbecile</em>, which is founded
on the alleged want of power in the President to arrest
this Crime. It is openly asserted, that, under existing
laws, the Chief Magistrate has no authority to interfere
in Kansas for this purpose. Such is the broad statement,
which, even if correct, furnishes no Apology for
any proposed ratification of the Crime, but which is in
reality untrue; and this I call the Apology of imbecility.</p>

<p>In other matters no such ostentatious imbecility appears.
Only lately, a vessel of war in the Pacific has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
chastised the cannibals of the Feejee Islands for alleged
outrage on American citizens. But no person of ordinary
intelligence will pretend that American citizens
in the Pacific have received wrongs from these cannibals
comparable in atrocity to those suffered by American
citizens in Kansas. Ah, Sir, the interests of Slavery
are not touched by any chastisement of Feejees!</p>

<p>Constantly we are informed of efforts at New York,
through the agency of the Government, and sometimes
only on the breath of suspicion, to arrest vessels about
to sail on foreign voyages in violation of our neutrality
laws or treaty stipulations. Now no man familiar with
the cases will presume to suggest that the urgency for
these arrests is equal to the urgency for interposition
against these successive invasions from Missouri. But
the Slave Power is not disturbed by such arrests in New
York.</p>

<p>At this moment the President exults in the vigilance
with which he prevented the enlistment of a few soldiers,
for transportation to Halifax, in breach of our
territorial sovereignty, and England is bravely threatened,
even to the extent of rupture of diplomatic relations,
for her endeavor, though unsuccessful, and at
once abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> No man in his senses will urge that
this act was anything but trivial by the side of the
Crime against Kansas. But the Slave Power is not
concerned in this controversy.</p>

<p>Thus, where the Slave Power is indifferent, the President
will see that the laws are faithfully executed; but
in other cases, where the interests of Slavery are at
stake, he is controlled absolutely by this tyranny, r<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>eady
at all times to do, or not to do, precisely as it dictates.
Therefore it is that Kansas is left a prey to the Propagandists
of Slavery, while the whole Treasury, the Army,
and Navy of the United States are lavished to hunt a
single slave through the streets of Boston. You have
not forgotten the latter instance; but I choose to refresh
it in your minds.</p>

<p>As long ago as 1851 the War Department and Navy
Department concurred in placing the forces of the United
States near Boston at the command of the Marshal,
if needed for the enforcement of an Act of Congress
which is without support in the public conscience, as
I believe it without support in the Constitution; and
thus these forces were degraded to the loathsome work
of slave-hunters. More than three years afterwards an
occasion arose for their intervention. A fugitive from
Virginia, who for some days had trod the streets of Boston
as a freeman, was seized as a slave. The whole
community was aroused, while Bunker Hill and Faneuil
Hall quaked with responsive indignation. Then, Sir, the
President, anxious that no tittle of Slavery should suffer,
was curiously eager in the enforcement of the statute.
The despatches between him and his agents in Boston
attest his zeal. Here are some of them.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, May 27, 1854.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<i>To the President of the United States.</i></p>

<p>“In consequence of an attack upon the Court House last

<p>“Incur any expense deemed necessary by the Marshal

execution of the law.</p>

<p class="sig3">“<span class="smcap">Franklin Pierce.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>The President was not content with the forces then
on hand in the neighborhood. Other posts also were
put under requisition. Two companies of national
troops, stationed at New York, were kept under arms,
ready at any moment to proceed to Boston; and the
Adjutant-General of the Army was directed to repair
to the scene, there to superintend the execution of the
statute. All this was done for the sake of Slavery.
But during long months of menace suspended over the
Free Soil of Kansas, breaking forth in successive invasions,
the President folds his hands in complete listlessness,
or, if he moves at all, it is only to encourage
the robber propagandists.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>
<p>And now the intelligence of the country is insulted
by the Apology, that the President had no power to
interfere. Why, Sir, to make this confession is to confess
our Government a practical failure, which I will
never do,&mdash;except, indeed, as it is administered now.
No, Sir, the imbecility of the Chief Magistrate shall not
be charged upon American Institutions. Where there
is a will, there is a way; and in his case, had the
will existed, there would have been a way, easy and
triumphant, to guard against the Crime we deplore.
His powers are in every respect ample; and this I
prove by the statute-book. By the Act of Congress of
28th February, 1795, it is enacted, “that, whenever the
laws of the United States shall be opposed, <em>or the execution
thereof obstructed</em>, in any State, by combinations
too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course
of judicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in the
marshals by this Act, it shall be lawful for the President
of the United States to call forth the militia.”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
By the supplementary Act of 3d March, 1807, in all
cases where he is authorized to call forth the militia
“for the purpose of causing the laws to be duly executed,”
the President is further empowered, in any State
<em>or Territory</em>, “to employ for the same purposes such
part of the land or naval force of the United States as
shall be judged necessary.”<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> There is the letter of the
law; and you will please to mark the power conferred.
In no case, where <em>the laws of the United States</em> are <em>opposed</em>,
or their execution <em>obstructed</em>, is the President constrained
to wait for the requisition of a Governor, or
even the petition of a citizen. Just so soon as he learns
the fact, no matter by what channel, he is invested by
law with full power to counteract it. True it is, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>,
when <em>the laws of a State</em> are obstructed, he can interfere
only on the application of the Legislature of such State,
or of the Executive, when the Legislature cannot be
convened; but when the National laws are obstructed,
no such preliminary application is necessary. It is his
high duty, under his oath of office, to see that they are
executed, and, if need be, by the National forces.</p>

<p>And, Sir, this is the precise exigency that arises in
Kansas,&mdash;exactly this,&mdash;nor more, nor less. The Act
of Congress constituting the very <em>organic law</em> of the
Territory, which, in peculiar phrase, as if to avoid ambiguity,
declares, as its “true intent and meaning,” that
the people thereof shall be left “perfectly free to form
and regulate their domestic institutions in their own
way,” has been from the beginning <em>opposed</em> and <em>obstructed</em>
in its execution. If the President had power to employ
the national forces in Boston, when he supposed
the Fugitive Slave Bill was obstructed, and merely in
anticipation of such obstruction, it is absurd to say that
he has not power in Kansas, when, in the face of the
whole country, the very <em>organic law</em> of the Territory is
trampled under foot by successive invasions, and the
freedom of the people there overthrown. To assert
ignorance of this obstruction&mdash;premeditated, long-continued,
and stretching through months&mdash;attributes to
him not merely imbecility, but idiocy. And thus do
I dispose of this Apology.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next comes the <em>Apology absurd</em>, which is, indeed, in
the nature of pretext. It is alleged that a small printed
pamphlet, containing the “Constitution and Ritual of
the Grand Encampment and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span> Regiments of the Kansas
Legion,” was taken from the person of one George F.
Warren, who attempted to avoid detection by chewing
it. The oaths and grandiose titles of the pretended
Legion are all set forth, and this poor mummery of a
secret society, which existed only on paper, is gravely
introduced on this floor, in order to extenuate the Crime
against Kansas. It has been paraded in more than one
speech, and even stuffed into the report of the Committee.</p>

<p>A part of the obligations assumed by the members of
this Legion shows why it is thus pursued, while also
attesting its innocence. It is as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I will never knowingly propose a person for membership
in this order <em>who is not in favor of making Kansas a Free
State</em>, and whom I feel satisfied will exert his entire influence
to bring about this result. I will support, maintain, and
abide by any honorable movement made by the organization
to secure this great end, <em>which will not conflict with the laws
of the country and the Constitution of the United States</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Kansas is to be made a Free State by an honorable
movement which will not conflict with the laws and
the Constitution. That is the object of the organization,
declared in the very words of the initiatory obligation.
Where is the wrong in this? What is there here to
cast reproach, or even suspicion, upon the people of
Kansas? Grant that the Legion was constituted, can
you extract from it any Apology for the original Crime,
or for its present ratification? Secret societies, with
extravagant oaths, are justly offensive; but who can
find in this mistaken machinery any excuse for the denial
of all rights to the people of Kansas? All this I
say on the supposition that the society is a real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>ity, which
it is not. Existing in the fantastic brains of a few persons
only, it never had any practical life. It was never
organized. The whole tale, with the mode of obtaining
the copy of the Constitution, is at once cock-and-bull
story and mare’s nest,&mdash;trivial as the former, absurd
as the latter,&mdash;and to be dismissed, with the Apology
founded upon it, to the derision which triviality and
absurdity justly receive.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It only remains, under this head, that I should speak
of the <em>Apology infamous</em>,&mdash;founded on false testimony
against the Emigrant Aid Company, and assumptions
of duty more false than the testimony. Defying truth
and mocking decency, this Apology excels all others in
futility and audacity, while, from its utter hollowness,
it proves the utter impotence of the conspirators to defend
their Crime. Falsehood, always <em>infamous</em>, in this
case arouses unwonted scorn. An association of sincere
benevolence, faithful to the Constitution and laws, whose
only fortifications are hotels, school-houses, and churches,
whose only weapons are saw-mills, tools, and books,
whose mission is peace and good-will, is grossly assailed
on this floor, and an errand of blameless virtue made the
pretext for an unpardonable Crime. Nay, more,&mdash;the
innocent are sacrificed, and the guilty set at liberty.
They who seek to do the mission of the Saviour are
scourged and crucified, while the murderer, Barabbas,
with the sympathy of the chief priests, goes at large.</p>

<p>Were I to take counsel of my own feelings, I should
dismiss this whole Apology to the ineffable contempt
which it deserves; but it is made to play such a part
in this conspiracy, that I feel it a duty to expose it completely.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>
<p>Sir, from the earliest times, men have recognized the
advantages of organization, as an effective agency in
promoting the business of life. Especially at this moment,
there is no interest, public or private, high or low,
of charity or trade, of luxury or convenience, which does
not seek its aid. Men organize to rear churches and
to make pins,&mdash;to build schools and to sail ships,&mdash;to
construct roads and to manufacture toys,&mdash;to spin cotton
and to print books,&mdash;to weave cloths and to increase
harvests,&mdash;to provide food and to distribute light,&mdash;to
influence Public Opinion and to secure votes,&mdash;to guard
infancy in its weakness, old age in its decrepitude, and
womanhood in its wretchedness; and now, in all large
towns, when death has come, they are buried by organized
societies, and, emigrants to another world,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> they lie
down in pleasant places, adorned by organized skill.
To complain that this prevailing principle has been applied
to living emigration is to complain of Providence
and the irresistible tendencies implanted in man.</p>

<p>This application of the principle is no recent invention,
brought forth for an existing emergency. It has
the best stamp of Antiquity. It showed itself in the
brightest days of Greece, where colonists moved in organized
bands. It became part of the mature policy
of Rome, where bodies of men were constituted expressly
for this purpose,&mdash;<em>triumviri ad colonos deducendos</em>.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
Naturally it is accepted in modern times by every civilized
state. With the sanction of Spain, an association
of Genoese merchants first introduced slaves to
this continent. With the sanction of France, th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>e Society
of Jesuits stretched their labors over Canada and
the Great Lakes to the Mississippi. It was under the
auspices of Emigrant Aid Companies that our country
was originally settled by the Pilgrim Fathers of Plymouth,
by the Adventurers of Virginia, and by the philanthropic
Oglethorpe, whose “benevolent soul,” commemorated
by Pope, sought to plant a Free State in Georgia.
At this day, such associations, of humbler character, are
found in Europe, with offices in the great capitals, through
whose activity emigrants are directed hither.</p>

<p>For a long time, emigration to the West, from the
Northern and Middle States, but particularly from New
England, has been of marked significance. In quest of
better homes, annually it presses to the unsettled lands,
in numbers counted by tens of thousands; but this has
been done heretofore with little knowledge, and without
guide or counsel. Finally, when, by the establishment
of a government in Kansas, the tempting fields of that
central region were opened to the competition of peaceful
colonization, and especially when it was declared
that the question of Freedom or Slavery there was to
be determined by the votes of actual settlers, then at
once was organization enlisted as an effective agency
in quickening and conducting the emigration impelled
thither, and, more than all, in providing homes on its
arrival.</p>

<p>The Company was first constituted under an Act of
the Legislature of Massachusetts, April 26, 1854, some
weeks prior to the passage of the Nebraska Bill. The
original act of incorporation was subsequently abandoned,
and a new charter received in February, 1855, in
which the objects of the Society are thus declared:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For the purposes of directing emigration westward, and
<em>aiding in providing accommodations for the emigrants after
arriving at their places of destination</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At any other moment an association for these purposes
would take its place, by general consent, among
philanthropic experiments; but Crime is always suspicious,
and shakes, like a sick man, merely at the
pointing of a finger. The conspirators against Freedom
in Kansas became alarmed at the movement. Their
wicked plot was about to fail. To help themselves,
they denounced the Emigrant Aid Company; and their
denunciations, after finding an echo in the President,
are repeated, with much particularity, on this floor, in
the formal report of your Committee.</p>

<p>The falsehood of the whole accusation will appear in
illustrative instances.</p>

<p>A charter is set out, section by section, which, though
originally granted, was subsequently abandoned, and is
not in reality the charter of the Company, but is materially
unlike it.</p>

<p>The Company is represented as “a powerful corporation,
with a capital of five millions,” when, by its actual
charter, it is not allowed to hold property above one
million, and, in point of fact, its capital has not exceeded
one hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Then, again, it is suggested, if not alleged, that this
enormous capital, which I have already said does not
exist, is invested in “cannon and rifles, in powder and
lead,” and “implements of war,” all of which, whether
alleged or suggested, is absolutely false. The officers
of the Company authorize me to give this whole assumption
a point-blank denial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>

<p>These allegations are of small importance, and I mention
them only because they show the character of the
report, and also something of the quicksand on which
the Senator from Illinois chooses to plant himself. But
these are all capped by the unblushing assertion, that
the proceedings of the Company were “in perversion
of the plain provisions of an Act of Congress,”&mdash;and
also another unblushing assertion, as “certain and undeniable,”
that the Company was formed to promote
certain objects, “regardless of the rights and wishes
of the people, as guarantied by the Constitution of
the United States, and secured by their organic law,”
when it is certain and undeniable that the Company
has done nothing in perversion of any Act of Congress,
while, to the extent of its power, it seeks to protect
the rights and wishes of the actual people in the
Territory.</p>

<p>Sir, this Company has violated in no respect the Constitution
or laws of the land,&mdash;not in the merest letter
or the slightest spirit. But every other imputation is
equally baseless. It is not true, as the Senator from
Illinois alleges, in order in some way to compromise the
Company, that it was informed before the public of the
date fixed for the election of the Legislature. This
statement is pronounced by the Secretary, in a letter
now before me, “an unqualified falsehood, not having
even the shadow of a shade of truth for its basis.” It
is not true that men have been hired by the Company
to go to Kansas; for every emigrant going under its
direction himself provides the means for his journey.
Of course, Sir, it is not true, as is complained by the
Senator from South Carolina, with that proclivity to
error which marks all his utterances, that men have
been sent by the Company “with one uniform gun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
Sharp’s rifle”; for it has supplied no arms of any kind
to anybody. It is not true that the Company has encouraged
any fanatical aggression upon the people of
Missouri; for it counsels order, peace, forbearance. It
is not true that the Company has chosen its emigrants
on account of political opinions; for it asks no questions
with regard to the opinions of any whom it aids,
and at this moment stands ready to forward those from
the South as well as the North, while, in the Territory,
all, from whatever quarter, are admitted to equal enjoyment
of its tempting advantages. It is not true that
the Company has sent persons merely to control elections,
and not to remain in the Territory; for its whole
action, and all its anticipation of pecuniary profits, are
founded on the hope of stocking the country with permanent
settlers, by whose labor the capital of the Company
shall be made to yield its increase, and by whose
fixed interest in the soil the welfare of all shall be
promoted.</p>

<p>Sir, it has not the honor of being an Abolition Society,
or of numbering Abolitionists among its officers. Its
President<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> is a retired citizen, of ample means and charitable
life, who has taken no part in the conflicts with
Slavery, and never allowed his sympathies to be felt by
Abolitionists. One of its Vice-Presidents is a gentleman
from Virginia,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> with family and friends there, who
has always opposed the Abolitionists. Its generous
Treasurer,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> now justly absorbed by the objects of the
Company, has always been understood as ranging with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
his extensive connections, by blood and marriage, on
the side of that quietism which submits to all the tyranny
of the Slave Power. Its Directors are more conspicuous
for wealth and science than for any activity
against Slavery. Among these is an eminent lawyer
of Massachusetts, Mr. Chapman,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>&mdash;personally known,
doubtless, to some who hear me,&mdash;who has distinguished
himself by an austere conservatism, too natural
to the atmosphere of courts, which does not flinch
even from the support of the Fugitive Slave Bill. In
a recent address at a public meeting in Springfield,
this gentleman thus speaks for himself and his associates:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have been a Director of the Society from the first, and
have kept myself well informed in regard to its proceedings.
I am not aware that any one in this community ever suspected
me of being an Abolitionist; but I have been accused
of being Proslavery, and I believe many good people think
I am quite too conservative on that subject. I take this
occasion to say that all the plans and proceedings of the
Society have met my approbation; and I assert that it has
never done a single act with which any political party or
the people of any section of the country can justly find fault.
The name of its President, Mr. Brown, of Providence, and of
its Treasurer, Mr. Lawrence, of Boston, are a sufficient guaranty,
in the estimation of intelligent men, against its being
engaged in any fanatical enterprise. Its stockholders are
composed of men of all political parties except Abolitionists.
I am not aware that it has received the patronage of that
class of our fellow-citizens, and I am informed that some of
them disapprove of its proceedings.”</p>

</div>

<p>The acts of the Company have been such as might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>expected from auspices thus severely careful at all points.
The secret through which, with small means, it has been
able to accomplish so much is, that, <em>as inducement to
emigration, it goes forward and plants capital in advance
of population</em>. According to the old immethodical system,
this rule is reversed, and population is left to grope
blindly, without the advantage of fixed centres, with
mills, schools, and churches,&mdash;all calculated to soften
the hardships of pioneer life,&mdash;such as are established
beforehand in Kansas. Here, Sir, is the secret of the
Emigrant Aid Company. By this single principle,
which is now practically applied for the first time in
history, and which has the simplicity of genius, a business
association at a distance, without large capital,
has become the beneficent instrument of civilization,
exercising the functions of various societies, and being
in itself Missionary Society, Bible Society, Tract
Society, Education Society, and Society for the Diffusion
of the Mechanic Arts. I would not claim too
much for this Company; but I doubt if at this moment
there is any society so completely philanthropic; and
since its leading idea, like the light of a candle from
which other candles are lighted without number, may be
applied indefinitely, it promises to be an important aid
to Human Progress. The lesson it teaches cannot be
forgotten; and hereafter, wherever unsettled lands exist,
intelligent capital will lead the way, anticipating the
wants of the pioneer,&mdash;nay, doing the very work of the
original pioneer,&mdash;while, amidst well-arranged harmonies,
a new community arises, to become, by example,
a more eloquent preacher than any solitary missionary.
In subordination to this essential idea is its humbler
machinery for the aid of emigrants on their way, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
combining parties, so that friends and neighbors journey
together,&mdash;by purchasing tickets at wholesale, and furnishing
them to individuals at actual cost,&mdash;by providing
for each party a conductor familiar with the road,
and, through these simple means, promoting the economy,
safety, and comfort of the expedition. The number
of emigrants it has directly aided, even thus slightly, in
their journey, is infinitely exaggerated. From the beginning
of its operations down to the close of the last
autumn, all its detachments from Massachusetts contained
only thirteen hundred and twelve persons.</p>

<p>Such is the simple tale of the Emigrant Aid Company.
Sir, not even suspicion can justly touch it. But it must
be made a scapegoat. This is the decree which has gone
forth. I was hardly surprised at this outrage, when it
proceeded from the President, for, like Macbeth, he is
“stepped in so far,” that “returning were as tedious as
go o’er”; but I did not expect it from the Senator from
Missouri [Mr. <span class="smcap">Geyer</span>], whom I have learned to respect
for the general moderation of his views, and the name
he has won in an honorable profession. Listening to
him, I was saddened by the spectacle of the extent to
which Slavery will sway a candid mind to do injustice.
Were any other interest in question, that Senator would
scorn to join in impeachment of such an association.
His instincts, as lawyer, as man of honor, and as Senator,
would forbid; but the Slave Power, in enforcing
its behests, allows no hesitation, and the Senator surrenders.</p>

<p>In this vindication I content myself with a statement
of facts, rather than an argument. It might be urged
that Missouri organized a propagandist emigration long
before any from Massachusetts, and you might be remind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>ed
of the wolf in the fable, which complained of the
lamb for disturbing the waters, when in fact the alleged
offender was lower down the stream. It might be urged
also that South Carolina lately entered upon a similar
system,&mdash;while one of her chieftains, in rallying recruits,
has unconsciously attested the cause in which
he was engaged, by exclaiming, in the words of Satan,
addressed to his wicked forces,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Awake! arise! or be forever fallen!”<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the occasion needs no such defences. I put them
aside. Not on the example of Missouri or the example
of South Carolina, but on inherent rights, which
no man, whether Senator or President, can justly assail,
do I plant this impregnable justification. It will
not do, in specious phrase, to allege the right of every
State to be free in domestic policy from foreign interference,
and then to assume such wrongful interference
by this Company. By the law and Constitution
we stand or fall; and that law and Constitution we
have in no respect offended.</p>

<p>To cloak the overthrow of all law in Kansas, an assumption
is now set up which utterly denies one of the
plainest rights of the people everywhere. Sir, I beg
Senators to understand that this is a government of
laws, and that, under these laws, the people have an incontestable
right to settle any portion of our broad territory,
and, if they choose, to propagate any opinions
there not forbidden by the laws. If this be not so,
pray, Sir, by what title is the Senator from Illino<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>is, who
is an emigrant from Vermont,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> propagating his disastrous
opinions in another State? Surely he has no monopoly
of this right. Others may do what he is doing; nor can
the right be in any way restricted. It is as broad as the
people; nor does it matter whether they go in numbers
small or great, with assistance or without assistance,
under the auspices of societies or not under such auspices.
If this be not so, then by what title are so
many foreigners annually naturalized, under Democratic
auspices, in order to secure votes for misnamed Democratic
principles? And if capital as well as combination
cannot be employed, by what title do venerable associations
exist, of ampler means and longer duration than
any Emigrant Aid Company, around which cluster the
regard and confidence of the country,&mdash;the Tract Society,
a powerful corporation, which scatters its publications
freely in every corner of the land,&mdash;the Bible Society,
an incorporated body, with large resources, which
seeks to carry the Book of Life alike into Territories and
States,&mdash;the Missionary Society, also an incorporated
body, with large resources, which sends its agents everywhere,
at home and in foreign lands? By what title do
all these exist? Nay, Sir, by what title does an Insurance
Company in New York send its agent to open an
office in New Orleans? and by what title does Massachusetts
capital contribute to the Hannibal and St. Joseph
Railroad in Missouri, and also to the copper mines
of Michigan? The Senator inveighs against the Native
American party; but his own principle is narrower than
any attributed to them. They object to the influence
of emigrants from abroad: he objects to the influence of
American citizens at home, when exerted in States or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Territories where they were not born. The whole assumption
is too audacious for respectful argument. But
since a great right is denied, the children of the Free
States, over whose cradles has shone the North Star, owe
it to themselves, to their ancestors, and to Freedom itself,
that this right shall now be asserted to the fullest
extent. By the blessing of God, and under the continued
protection of the laws, they will go to Kansas, there
to plant homes, in the hope of elevating this Territory
soon into the sisterhood of Free States; and to such end
they will not hesitate in the employment of all legitimate
means, whether by companies of men or contributions
of money, to swell a virtuous emigration, and they
will justly scout any attempt to question this unquestionable
right. Sir, if they fail to do this, they will be
fit only for slaves themselves.</p>

<p>God be praised, Massachusetts, honored Commonwealth,
that gives me the privilege to plead for Kansas
on this floor, knows her rights, and will maintain them
firmly to the end. This is not the first time in history
that her public acts have been impeached and her public
men exposed to contumely. Thus was it in the olden
time, when she began the great battle whose fruits you
all enjoy. But never yet has she occupied a position so
lofty as at this hour. By the intelligence of her population,
by the resources of her industry, by her commerce,
cleaving every wave, by her manufactures, various
as human skill, by her institutions of education,
various as human knowledge, by her institutions of benevolence,
various as human suffering, by the pages of
her scholars and historians, by the voices of her poets
and orators, she is now exerting an influence more subtile
and commanding than ever before,&mdash;shooting her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
far-darting rays wherever ignorance, wretchedness, or
wrong prevails, and flashing light even upon those who
travel far to persecute her. Such is Massachusetts; and
I am proud to believe that you may as well attempt
with puny arm to topple down the earth-rooted, heaven-kissing
granite which crowns the historic sod of Bunker
Hill as to change her fixed resolve for Freedom everywhere,
and especially now for Freedom in Kansas. I
exult, too, that in this battle, which in moral grandeur
surpasses far the whole war of the Revolution, she is able
to preserve her just eminence. To the first she contributed
troops in larger numbers than any other State, and
larger than all the Slave States together; and now to
the second, which is not of contending armies, but of
contending opinions, on whose issue hangs trembling
the advancing civilization of the age, she contributes,
through the manifold and endless intellectual activity
of her children, more of that divine spark by which
opinions are quickened into life than is contributed by
any other State, or by all the Slave States together,
while her annual productive industry exceeds in value
three times the whole vaunted cotton crop of the
whole South.</p>

<p>Sir, to men on earth it belongs only to deserve success,
not to secure it; and I know not how soon the efforts of
Massachusetts will wear the crown of triumph. But it
cannot be that she acts wrong for herself or her children,
when in this cause she encounters reproach. No:
by the generous souls once exposed at Lexington,&mdash;by
those who stood arrayed at Bunker Hill,&mdash;by the many
from her bosom who, on all the fields of the first great
struggle, lent their vigorous arms to the cause of all,&mdash;by
the children she has borne, whose names alone are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
national trophies, is Massachusetts now vowed irrevocably
to this work. What belongs to the faithful servant
she will do in all things, and Providence shall determine
the result.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>And here ends what I have to say of the four Apologies
for the Crime against Kansas.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>From this ample survey, where one obstruction after
another has been removed, I now pass, in the third
place, to the consideration of the <em>remedies proposed</em>, ending
with <span class="smcap">the True Remedy</span>.</p>

<p>The Remedy should be coextensive with the original
Wrong; and since, by the passage of the Nebraska Bill,
not only Kansas, but also Nebraska, Minnesota, Washington,
and even Oregon, are opened to Slavery, the original
Prohibition should be restored to its full activity
throughout these various Territories. By such happy
restoration, made in good faith, the whole country would
be replaced in the condition it enjoyed before the introduction
of that dishonest measure. Here is the Alpha
and the Omega of our aim in this immediate controversy.
But no such extensive measure is now in question.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
The Crime against Kansas is special, and all else
is absorbed in the special remedies for it. Of these I
shall now speak.</p>

<p>As the Apologies were fourfold, so are the proposed
Remedies fourfold; and they range themselves in natural
order, under designations which so truly disclose
their character as even to supersede argument. First,
we have <em>the Remedy of Tyranny</em>; next, <em>the Remedy of
Folly</em>; next, <em>the Remedy of Injustice and Civil War</em>;
and, fourthly, <em>the Remedy of Justice and Peace</em>. There
are the four caskets; and you are to determine which
shall be opened by Senatorial votes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is <em>the Remedy of Tyranny</em>, which, like its complement,
the Apology of Tyranny,&mdash;though espoused on
this floor, especially by the Senator from Illinois,&mdash;proceeds
from the President, and is embodied in a special
message. It proposes enforced obedience to the existing
laws of Kansas, “whether Federal or <em>local</em>,” when, in
fact, Kansas has no “local” laws, except those imposed
by the Usurpation from Missouri, and it calls for additional
appropriations to complete this work of tyranny.</p>

<p>I shall not follow the President in his elaborate endeavor
to prejudge the contested election now pending
in the House of Representatives; for this whole matter
belongs to the privileges of that body, and neither the
President nor the Senate has a right to intermeddle
therewith. I do not touch it. But now, while dismissing
it, I should not pardon myself, if I failed to add, that
any person who founds his claim to a seat in Congress
on the pretended votes of hirelings from another State,
with no home on the soil of Kansas, plays the part of
Anacharsis Clootz, who, at the bar of the French Conv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>ention,
undertook to represent nations that knew him
not, or, if they knew him, scorned him, with this difference,
that in our American case the excessive farce
of the transaction cannot cover its tragedy. But all
this I put aside, to deal only with what is legitimately
before the Senate.</p>

<p>I expose simply the tyranny which upholds the existing
Usurpation, and asks for additional appropriations.
Let it be judged by example from which in this country
there can be no appeal. Here is the speech of George
the Third, made from his throne to Parliament, in response
to the complaints of the Province of Massachusetts
Bay, which, though smarting under laws passed
by usurped power, had yet avoided all armed opposition,
while Lexington and Bunker Hill still slumbered in
rural solitude, unconscious of the historic kindred they
were soon to claim. Instead of Massachusetts Bay,
in the royal speech, substitute Kansas, and the message
of the President will be found fresh on the lips of the
British King. Listen now to the words, which, in opening
Parliament, 30th November, 1774, his Majesty, according
to the official report, was pleased to speak.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<i>My Lords and Gentlemen</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It gives me much concern, that I am obliged, at the opening
of this Parliament, to inform you that a most daring
<em>spirit of resistance and disobedience to the law</em> still unhappily
prevails in the Province of the <em>Massachusetts Bay</em>, and has
in divers parts of it broke forth in fresh violences of a very
criminal nature. <em>These proceedings have been countenanced
and encouraged in other of my Colonies, and unwarrantable
attempts have been made to obstruct the commerce of this kingdom
by unlawful combinations.</em> I have taken such measures
and given such orders as I judged most proper and effectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span><em>for carrying into execution the laws which were passed in the
last session of the late Parliament</em>, for the protection and security
of the commerce of my subjects, and for the restoring
and preserving peace, order, and good government in the
Province of the <em>Massachusetts Bay</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The King complained of a “daring spirit of resistance
and disobedience to the law”: so also does the President.
The King adds, that it has “broke forth in fresh
violences of a very criminal nature”: so also does the
President. The King declares that these proceedings
have been “countenanced and encouraged in other of
my Colonies”: even so the President declares that
Kansas has found sympathy in “remote States.” The
King inveighs against “unwarrantable attempts” and
“unlawful combinations”: even so inveighs the President.
The King proclaims that he has taken the necessary
steps “for carrying into execution the laws,” passed
in defiance of the constitutional rights of the Colonies:
even so the President proclaims that he shall “exert
the whole power of the Federal Executive” to support
the Usurpation in Kansas. The parallel is complete.
The Message, if not copied from the Speech of the
King, has been fashioned on the same original block,
and must be dismissed to the same limbo. I dismiss
its tyrannical assumptions in favor of the Usurpation.
I dismiss also its petition for additional appropriations,
in the affected desire to maintain order in Kansas. It
is not money or troops that you need there, but simply
the good-will of the President. That is all, absolutely.
Let his complicity with the Crime cease, and peace will
be restored. For myself, I will not consent to wad the
national artillery with fresh appropriation bills, whe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>n
its murderous hail is to be directed against the constitutional
rights of my fellow-citizens.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next comes <em>the Remedy of Folly</em>, which, indeed, is
also a Remedy of Tyranny; but its Folly is so surpassing
as to eclipse even its Tyranny. It does not proceed
from the President. With this proposition he is not
in any way chargeable. It comes from the Senator
from South Carolina, who, at the close of a long speech,
offered it as his single contribution to the adjustment
of this question, and who thus far stands alone in its
support. It might, therefore, fitly bear his name; but
that which I now give to it is a more suggestive synonym.</p>

<p>This proposition, nakedly expressed, is, that the people
of Kansas should be deprived of their arms. That
I may not do the least injustice to the Senator, I quote
his precise words.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The President of the United States is under the highest
and most solemn obligations to interpose; and if I were to
indicate the manner in which he should interpose in Kansas,
I would point out the old Common Law process. I would
serve a warrant on Sharp’s rifles; and if Sharp’s rifles did
not answer the summons, and come into court on a day certain,
or if they resisted the sheriff, I would summon the
<i>posse comitatus</i>, and I would have Colonel Sumner’s regiment
to be part of that <em>posse comitatus</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Really, Sir, has it come to this? The rifle has ever
been the companion of the pioneer, and, under God, his
tutelary protector against the red man and the beast
of the forest. Never was this efficient weapon more
needed in just self-defence than now in Kansas; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
at least one article in our National Constitution must
be blotted out before the complete right to it can be
in any way impeached. And yet such is the madness
of the hour, that, in defiance of the solemn guaranty
in the Amendments to the Constitution, that “the
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
infringed,” the people of Kansas are arraigned for keeping
and bearing arms, and the Senator from South Carolina
has the face to say openly on this floor that they
should be disarmed,&mdash;of course that the fanatics of
Slavery, his allies and constituents, may meet no impediment.
Sir, the Senator is venerable with years; he
is reputed also to have worn at home, in the State he
represents, judicial honors; and he is placed here at the
head of an important Committee occupied particularly
with questions of law; but neither his years, nor his
position, past or present, can give respectability to the
demand he makes, or save him from indignant condemnation,
when, to compass the wretched purposes of
a wretched cause, he thus proposes to trample on one of
the plainest provisions of Constitutional Liberty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next comes <em>the Remedy of Injustice and Civil War</em>,&mdash;organized
by Acts of Congress. This proposition,
which is also an offshoot of the original Remedy of
Tyranny, proceeds from the Senator from Illinois [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Douglas</span>], with the sanction of the Committee on
Territories, and is embodied in the bill now pressed
to a vote.</p>

<p>By this bill it is proposed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That, whenever it shall appear, by a census to be taken
under the direction of the Governor, by the authority of the
Legislature, that there shall be 93,420 inhabitants (that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>being the number required by the present ratio of representation
for a member of Congress) within the limits hereafter
described as the Territory of Kansas, <em>the Legislature of said
Territory shall be, and is hereby, authorized to provide by law
for the election of delegates</em> by the people of said Territory, to
assemble in Convention and form a Constitution and State
Government, preparatory to their admission into the Union
on an equal footing with the original States in all respects
whatsoever, by the name of the State of Kansas.”<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Now, Sir, consider these words carefully, and you will
see, that, however plausible and velvet-pawed they may
seem, yet in reality they are most unjust and cruel.
While affecting to initiate honest proceedings for the
formation of a State, they furnish to this Territory no
redress for the Crime under which it suffers; nay, they
recognize the very Usurpation in which the Crime ends,
and proceed to endow it with new prerogatives. It is
<em>by authority of the Legislature</em> that the census is to be
taken, which is the first step in the work. It is also <em>by
authority of the Legislature</em> that a Convention is to be
called for the formation of a Constitution, which is the
second step. But the Legislature is not obliged to take
either of these steps. To its absolute wilfulness is it
left to act or not to act in the premises. And since, in
the ordinary course of business, there can be no action
of the Legislature till January of the next year, all these
steps, which are preliminary in character, are postponed
till after that distant day,&mdash;thus keeping this great
question open, to distract and irritate the country.
Clearly this is not what is required. The country de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>sires
peace at once, and is determined to have it. But
this objection is slight by the side of the glaring tyranny,
that, in recognizing the Legislature, and conferring
upon it these new powers, the bill recognizes the
existing Usurpation, not only as the authentic government
of the Territory for the time being, but also as possessing
a creative power to reproduce itself in the new
State. Pass this bill, and you enlist Congress in the
conspiracy, not only to keep the people of Kansas in
their present subjugation throughout their Territorial
existence, but also to protract this subjugation into
their existence as a State, while you legalize and perpetuate
the very <em>force</em> by which Slavery is already
planted there.</p>

<p>I know that there is another deceptive clause which
seems to throw certain safeguards around the election
of delegates to the Convention, <em>when that Convention
shall be ordered by the Legislature</em>; but out of this very
clause do I draw judgment against the Usurpation which
the bill recognizes. It provides that the tests, coupled
with the electoral franchise, shall not prevail in the
election of delegates, and thus impliedly condemns them.
But if they are not to prevail on this occasion, why are
they permitted at the election of the Legislature? If
they are unjust in the one case, they are unjust in the
other. If annulled at the election of delegates, they
should be annulled at the election of the Legislature;
<em>whereas the bill of the Senator leaves all these offensive
tests in full activity at the election of the very Legislature
out of which this whole proceeding is to come</em>, and it
leaves the polls at both elections in the control of the
officers appointed by the Usurpation. Consider well the
facts. By existing statute establishing the Fugitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
Slave Bill as a shibboleth, a large portion of honest
citizens are excluded from voting for the Legislature,
while, by another statute, all who present themselves
with a fee of one dollar, whether from Missouri or not,
and who can pronounce this shibboleth, are entitled to
vote. And it is a Legislature thus chosen, under the
auspices of officers appointed by the Usurpation, that
you now propose to invest with parental powers to rear
the Territory into a State. You recognize and confirm
the Usurpation which you ought to annul without
delay. You put the infant State, now preparing
to take a place in our sisterhood, to suckle the wolf
which you ought at once to kill. The marvellous
story of Baron Munchausen is verified. The wolf which
thrust itself into the harness of the horse it had devoured,
and then whirled the sledge according to mere
brutal bent, is recognized by this bill, and kept in its
usurped place, when the safety of all requires that it
should be shot.</p>

<p>In characterizing this bill as <em>the Remedy of Injustice
and Civil War</em>, I give it a plain, self-evident title. It
is a continuation of the Crime against Kansas, and as
such deserves the same condemnation. It can be defended
only by those who defend the Crime. Sir, you
cannot expect that the people of Kansas will submit
to the Usurpation which this bill sets up and bids
them bow before, as the Austrian tyrant set up the
ducal hat in the Swiss market-place. If you madly
persevere, Kansas will not be without her William
Tell, who will refuse at all hazards to recognize the
tyrannical edict; and this will be the beginning of
civil war.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>
<p>Next, and lastly, comes <em>the Remedy of Justice and
Peace</em>, proposed by the Senator from New York [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Seward</span>], and embodied in his bill for the immediate
admission of Kansas as a State of this Union, now pending
as a substitute for the bill of the Senator from Illinois.
This is sustained by the prayer of the people of
the Territory, setting forth a Constitution formed by
spontaneous movement, in which all there had opportunity
to participate, without distinction of party. Rarely
is any proposition presented so simple in character, so
entirely practicable, so absolutely within your power,
and promising at once such beneficent results. In its
adoption, the Crime against Kansas will be all happily
absolved, the Usurpation it established peacefully suppressed,
and order permanently secured. By a joyful
metamorphosis this fair Territory may be saved from
outrage.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Oh, help,” she cries, “in this extremest need,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>In offering this proposition, the Senator from New
York has entitled himself to the gratitude of the country.
Throughout a life of unsurpassed industry and of
eminent ability, he has done much for Freedom, which
the world will not let die; but than this he has done
nothing more opportune, and he has uttered no words
more effective than the speech, so masterly and ingenious,
by which he vindicated it.</p>

<p>Kansas now presents herself for admission with a
Constitution republican in form. And, independently
of the great necessity of the case, three considerations of
fact concur in commending her. First, she thus testifies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
her willingness to relieve the National Government
of the considerable pecuniary responsibility to which it
is now exposed on account of the pretended Territorial
Government. Secondly, by her recent conduct, particularly
in repelling the invasion on the Wakarusa, she
has evinced an ability to defend her government. And,
thirdly, by the pecuniary credit she now enjoys, she
shows undoubted ability to support it. What can stand
in her way?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The power of Congress to admit Kansas at once is
explicit. It is found in a single clause of the Constitution,
which, taken by itself, without any qualification
applicable to the present case, and without doubtful
words, requires no commentary. Here it is.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“New States <em>may</em> be admitted by the Congress into this
Union; but no new State shall be formed or erected within
the jurisdiction of any other State, nor any State be formed
by the junction of two or more States, or parts of States,
without the consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned,
as well as of the Congress.”</p>

</div>

<p>New States <span class="smcap">MAY</span> be admitted. Out of that little
word <em>may</em> comes the power, broadly and fully, without
any limitation founded on population or preliminary
forms, provided the State is not within the jurisdiction
of another State, nor formed by the junction of two or
more States, or parts of States, without the consent of
the Legislatures of the States. Kansas is not within
the <em>legal</em> jurisdiction of another State, although the laws
of Missouri are tyrannically extended over her; nor is
Kansas formed by the junction of two or more States;
and therefore Kansas <em>may</em> be admitted by Congr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>ess into
the Union, without regard to population or preliminary
forms. You cannot deny the power, without obliterating
this clause. The Senator from New York was
right in rejecting all appeal to precedents as entirely
irrelevant; for the power invoked is clear and express
in the Constitution, which is above all precedent. But
since precedent is enlisted, let us look at precedent.</p>

<p>It is objected that the <em>population</em> of Kansas is not
sufficient for a State; and this objection is sustained by
under-reckoning the numbers there, and exaggerating
the numbers required by precedent. In the absence
of any recent census, it is impossible to do more than
approximate to the actual population; but, from careful
inquiry of the best sources, I am led to place it now
at 50,000, though I observe that a prudent authority, the
“Boston Daily Advertiser,” puts it as high as 60,000;
and while I speak, this remarkable population, fed
by fresh emigration, is outstripping even these calculations.
Nor can there be doubt, that, before the assent
of Congress can be perfected in the ordinary course of
legislation, this population will swell to the large number
of 93,420, required in the bill of the Senator from Illinois.
<em>But, in making this number the condition of the
admission of Kansas, you set up an extraordinary standard.</em>
There is nothing out of which it can be derived,
from the beginning to the end of the precedents. Going
back to the days of the Continental Congress, you find
that in 1784 it was declared that 20,000 free inhabitants
in a Territory might “establish a permanent Constitution
and Government for themselves”;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and though this
number was afterwards, in the Ordinance of 1787 for
the Northwestern Territory, raised to 60,000, yet t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>he
power was left in Congress, and subsequently exercised
in more than one instance, to constitute a State with
a smaller number. Out of all the new States, only
Maine, Wisconsin, and Texas contained, at the time of
admission into the Union, so large a population as is
required in Kansas,&mdash;while no less than <em>fifteen</em> new
States have been admitted with a smaller population,
as will appear by the following list, which is the result
of research, showing the number of “free inhabitants”
in these States at the date of the proceedings which
ended in their admission.</p>

</table>

<p>But this is not all. At the adoption of the National
Constitution there were three of the old Thirteen whose
respective populations did not reach the amount now
required of Kansas: these were Delaware, with only
50,209 free inhabitants; Rhode Island, with only 68,158
free inhabitants; and Georgia, with only 53,284 free
inhabitants. And even while I speak, there are at
least three States, with Senators on this floor, which,
according to the last census, do not contain the population
now required of Kansas: I refer to California,
with only 92,597 free inhabitants; Delaware, with
only 89,242 free inhabitants; and Florida, with only
48,135 free inhabitants. So much for precedents of
population.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>
<p>In sustaining this objection, it is not uncommon to
abandon the strict rule of numerical precedent, and to
allege that the population required in a new State has
always been, in point of fact, above the existing ratio
of representation for a member of the House of Representatives.
But this is not true; for no less than three
States, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Florida, being all
Slave States, were admitted with a free population below
this ratio. So much, again, for precedents. But
even if this coincidence were complete, it would be impossible
to press it into binding precedent. The rule
seems reasonable, and in ordinary cases would not be
questioned; but it cannot be drawn or implied from
the Constitution. Besides, this ratio is in itself a sliding
scale. At first it was 30,000, increased in 1793
to 33,000, and thus continued till 1813, when it was
put at 35,000. In 1823 it was 40,000; in 1833 it was
47,700; in 1843 it was 70,680; and now it is 93,420.
If any ratio is to be made the foundation of binding
rule, it should be that which prevailed at the adoption
of the Constitution,&mdash;or at least that which prevailed
when Kansas, as part of Louisiana, was acquired
from France, under solemn stipulation that it should
“be incorporated in the Union of the United States,
and admitted <em>as soon as possible</em>, according to the principles
of the Federal Constitution.” But this whole
objection is met by the memorial of the people of Florida,
which, if good for that State, is also good for Kansas.
Here is a passage.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But the people of Florida respectfully insist that their
right to be admitted into the Federal Union as a State is
not dependent upon the fact of their having a population
equal to such ratio. Their right to admission, it is conceived,
is guarantied by the express pledge in the sixth article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
of the treaty [with Spain] before quoted; and if any rule
as to the number of population is to govern, it should be
that in existence at the time of the cession, which was thirty-five
thousand.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> They submit, however, that any ratio of representation,
dependent on legislative action, based solely on
convenience and expediency, shifting and vacillating as the
opinion of a majority of Congress may make it, now greater
than at a previous apportionment, but which a future Congress
may prescribe to be less, cannot be one of the <em>constitutional</em>
‘<span class="smcap">PRINCIPLES</span>’ referred to in the treaty, consistency
with which, by its terms, is required. It is, in truth, but
a mere regulation, not founded on principle. No specific
number of population is required by any recognized principle
as necessary in the establishment of a free Government.&hellip;
It is in no wise ‘<em>inconsistent with the principles of the
Federal Constitution</em>’ that the population of a State should
be less than the ratio of Congressional representation. The
very case is provided for in the Constitution. With such
deficient population, she would be entitled to one Representative.
If any event should cause a decrease of the population
of one of the States even to a number below the <em>minimum</em>
ratio of representation prescribed by the Constitution,
she would still remain a member of the Confederacy, and be
entitled to such Representative. It is respectfully urged,
that a rule or principle which would not justify the <em>expulsion</em>
of a State with a deficient population, on the ground of
inconsistency with the Constitution, should not exclude or
prohibit <em>admission</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus, Sir, do the people of Florida plead for the people
of Kansas.</p>

<p>Distrusting the objection from inadequacy of population,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>it is said that <em>the proceedings for the formation
of a new State are fatally defective in form</em>. It is not
asserted that a previous enabling Act of Congress is
indispensable; for there are notorious precedents the
other way: among which are Kentucky, in 1791; Tennessee,
in 1796; Maine, in 1820; and Arkansas and
Michigan, in 1836. But it is urged that in no instance
has a State been admitted whose Constitution was
formed without such enabling Act, or without authority
of the Territorial Legislature. This is not true; for
California came into the Union with a Constitution
formed not only without any previous enabling Act,
but also without any sanction from a Territorial Legislature.
The proceedings which ended in this Constitution
were initiated by the military Governor there, acting
under the exigency of the hour. This instance may
not be identical in all respects with that of Kansas; but
it displaces completely one of the assumptions which
Kansas now encounters, and it completely shows the
disposition to relax all rule, under the exigency of the
occasion, in order to do substantial justice.</p>

<p>There is a memorable instance, which contains in
itself every element of irregularity which you denounce
in the proceedings of Kansas. Michigan, now cherished
with such pride as a sister State, achieved admission
into the Union in persistent defiance of all rule. Do
you ask for precedents? Here is a precedent for the
largest latitude, which you who profess deference to
precedent cannot disown. Mark now the stages of this
case. The first proceedings of Michigan were without
any previous enabling Act of Congress; and she presented
herself at your door with a Constitution thus
formed, and with Senators chosen under that C<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>onstitution,
precisely as Kansas does. This was in December,
1835, while Andrew Jackson was President. The leaders
of the Democracy at that time scouted all objection
for alleged defects of form, employing language strictly
applicable to Kansas. There is nothing new under the
sun; and the very objection of the President, that the
application of Kansas proceeds from “persons acting
against authorities duly constituted by Act of Congress,”<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
was hurled against the application of Michigan,
in debate on this floor. This was the language of Mr.
Hendricks, of Indiana:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But the people of Michigan, in presenting their Senate
and House of Representatives as the legislative power existing
there, <em>showed that they had trampled upon and violated
the laws of the United States establishing a Territorial Government
in Michigan</em>. These laws were, or ought to be, in full
force there; but, by the character and position assumed,
they had set up a Government antagonist to that of the
United States.”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

</div>

<p>To this impeachment Mr. Benton replied in these
effective words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Conventions were original acts of the people. They
depended upon inherent and inalienable rights. The people
of any State may at any time meet in Convention, without
a law of their Legislature, and without any provision, or
against any provision, in their Constitution, and may alter
or abolish the whole frame of Government as they please.
The sovereign power to govern themselves was in the majority,
and they could not be divested of it.”<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Buchanan vied with Mr. Benton in vindicating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>the new State.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The precedent in the case of Tennessee &hellip; has completely
silenced all opposition in regard to the necessity of
a previous Act of Congress to enable the people of Michigan
to form a State Constitution. It now seems to be conceded
that our subsequent approbation is equivalent to our previous
action. This can no longer be doubted. <em>We have the
unquestionable power of waiving any irregularities in the mode
of framing the Constitution, had any such existed.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>“He did hope that by this bill all objections would be removed,&mdash;and
that this State, so ready to rush into our arms,
would not be repulsed, <em>because of the absence of some formalities
which perhaps were very proper, but certainly not indispensable</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

</div>

<p>After an animated contest in the Senate, the bill for
the admission of Michigan, <em>on her assent to certain conditions</em>,
was passed, by 23 yeas to 8 nays. You find
weight, as well as numbers, on the side of the new
State. Among the yeas were Thomas H. Benton, of
Missouri, James Buchanan, of Pennsylvania, Silas
Wright, of New York, and William R. King, of Alabama.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
Subsequently, on motion of Mr. Buchanan,
the gentlemen sent as Senators and Representative by
the new State received the regular compensation for
attendance throughout the very session in which their
seats had been so acrimoniously contested.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>In the House of Representatives the application was
equally successful. The Committee on the Judiciary,
in an elaborate report, reviewed the objections, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>d,
among other things, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the people of Michigan have without due authority
formed a State Government; but, nevertheless, <em>that Congress
has power to waive any objection which might on that account
be entertained</em> to the ratification of the Constitution which
they have adopted, and to admit their Senators and Representatives
to take their seats in the Congress of the United
States.”<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The House sustained this view by a vote of 153 yeas
to 45 nays. In this large majority, by which the title
of Michigan was then recognized, will be found the
name of Franklin Pierce, at that time a Representative
from New Hampshire.</p>

<p>But the case was not ended. The fiercest trial and
the greatest irregularity remained. The Act providing
for the admission of the new State contained a modification
of its boundaries, and proceeded to require, as
<em>a fundamental condition</em>, that these should “receive the
assent of a Convention of delegates elected by the people
of the said State, for the sole purpose of giving
the assent herein required.”<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Such a Convention, duly
elected under call from the Legislature, met in pursuance
of law, and, after consideration, declined to come
into the Union on the condition proposed. The action
of this Convention was not universally satisfactory;
and in order to effect admission into the Union, another
Convention was called, <em>professedly</em> by the people
in their sovereign capacity, without authority from
State or Territorial Legislature,&mdash;nay, Sir, borrowing
the language of the present President, “against authorities
duly constituted by Act of Congress,” <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>at least as
much as the recent Convention in Kansas. The irregularity
of this Convention was increased by the circumstance
that two of the oldest counties of the State, comprising
a population of some 25,000 souls, refused to
take part in it, even to the extent of not opening the
polls for the election of delegates, claiming that it was
held without warrant of law, and in defiance of the legal
Convention. This popular Convention, though wanting
popular support coextensive with the State, yet proceeded,
by formal act, to give the assent of the people
of Michigan to the fundamental condition proposed by
Congress.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the two Conventions were transmitted
to President Jackson, who, by message, 27th
December, 1836, laid them both before Congress, indicating
very clearly his desire to ascertain the will of
the people, without regard to form. The origin of the
popular Convention he thus describes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This latter Convention was not held or elected by virtue
of any Act of the Territorial or State Legislature. It originated
from the People themselves, and was chosen by them
in pursuance of resolutions adopted in primary assemblies
held in the respective counties.”<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And the President then declares, that, had these proceedings
come to him during the recess of Congress,
he should have felt it his duty, on being satisfied that
they emanated from a Convention of delegates elected
<em>in point of fact by the People of the State</em>, to issue his
proclamation for the admission of the State.</p>

<p>The Committee on the Judiciary in the Senate, of
which Felix Grundy was Chairman, after inquiry, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>recognized
the competency of the popular Convention, as
“elected by the People of the State of Michigan,” and
reported a bill, responsive to their acceptance of the
proposed condition, for the admission of the State without
further terms.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Then, Sir, appeared the very objections
now directed against Kansas. It was complained,
that the movement for immediate admission was the
work of “a minority,” and that “a great majority of
the State feel otherwise.”<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> And a leading Senator, of
great ability and integrity, Mr. Ewing, of Ohio, broke
forth in catechism which would do for the present hour.
He exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What evidence had the Senate of the organization of the
Convention? of the organization of the popular assemblies
who appointed their delegates to that Convention? None
on earth. Who they were that met and voted we had no
information. Who gave the notice? And for what did the
People receive that notice? To meet and elect? What evidence
was there that the Convention acted according to
law? Were the delegates sworn? And if so, they were
extrajudicial oaths, and not binding upon them.&hellip; Were
the votes counted? In fact, it was not a proceeding under
the forms of law, for they were totally disregarded.”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And the same able Senator, on another occasion, after
exposing the imperfect evidence with regard to the
action of the Convention, existing only in letters and
in an article from a Detroit newspaper, again exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“This, Sir, is the evidence to support an organic law of a
new State about to enter the Union,&mdash;yes, of an organic
law, the very highest act a community of men can perform:
letters referring to other letters, and a scrap of a newspaper!”<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It was Mr. Calhoun, however, who pressed the opposition
with the most persevering intensity. In his
sight, the admission of Michigan, under the circumstances,
“would be the most monstrous proceeding
under our Constitution, that can be conceived, the
most repugnant to its principles and dangerous in its
consequences.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> “There is not,” he exclaimed, “one
particle of official evidence before us. We have nothing
but the private letters of individuals, who do not
know even the numbers that voted on either occasion.
They know nothing of the qualifications of voters, nor
how their votes were received, nor by whom counted.”<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
And he proceeded to characterize the popular Convention
as “not only a party caucus, for party purpose,
but a criminal meeting,&mdash;a meeting to subvert the
authority of the State, and to assume its sovereignty,”&mdash;adding,
that “the actors in that meeting might be
indicted, tried, and punished.”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> And he expressed astonishment
that “a self-created meeting, convened for a
criminal object, had dared to present to this Government
an act of theirs, and to expect that we are to receive
this irregular and criminal act, as a fulfilment of the
condition which we had prescribed for the admission
of the State.”<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> No stronger words are employed against
Kansas.</p>

<p>The single question on which all the proceedings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>then hinged, and which is as pertinent in the case of
Kansas as in the case of Michigan, was thus put by Mr.
Morris, of Ohio: “<em>Will Congress recognize as valid, constitutional,
and obligatory, without the color of a law of
Michigan to sustain it, an act done by the People of that
State in their primary assemblies, and acknowledge that act
as obligatory on the constituted authorities and Legislature
of the State?</em>”<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> This question, thus distinctly presented,
was answered in debate by able Senators, among
whom were Mr. Benton and Mr. King. There was one
person, who has since enjoyed much public confidence,
and left many memorials of an industrious career in
the Senate and in diplomatic life, James Buchanan, who
rendered himself conspicuous by the ability and ardor
with which, against all assault, he upheld the cause of
the popular Convention, which was so strongly denounced,
and the entire conformity of its proceedings
with the genius of American Institutions. His speeches
on that occasion contain an unanswerable argument at
all points, <i>mutato nomine</i>, for the immediate admission
of Kansas under her present Constitution; nor is there
anything by which he is now distinguished that will redound
so truly to his fame, if he only continues true to
them. The question was emphatically answered in the
Senate by the final vote on the passage of the bill,
where we find 25 yeas to only 10 nays. In the House
of Representatives, after debate, the question was answered
in the same way, by a vote, on ordering the bill
to a third reading, of 140 yeas to 57 nays; and among
the yeas is again the name of <span class="smcap">Franklin Pierce</span>, a Representative
from New Hampshire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, in that day, by triumphant votes, did the cause
of Kansas prevail in the name of Michigan. A popular
Convention, called absolutely without authority,
and containing delegates from a portion only of the
population,&mdash;called, too, in opposition to constituted
authorities, and in derogation of another Convention
assembled under forms of law,&mdash;stigmatized as a caucus
and a criminal meeting, whose authors were liable
to indictment, trial, and punishment,&mdash;was, after
ample debate, recognized by Congress as valid; and
Michigan now holds her place in the Union, and her
Senators sit on this floor, by virtue of that act. Sir, if
Michigan is legitimate, Kansas cannot be illegitimate.
You bastardize Michigan, when you refuse to recognize
Kansas.</p>

<p>But this is not all. The precedent is still more
clinching. Thus far I have followed exclusively the
public documents laid before Congress, and illustrated
by the debates of that body; but well-authenticated
facts, not of record here, make the case stronger still.
It is sometimes said that the proceedings in Kansas
are defective because they originated in a party. This
is not true; but even if it were true, yet would they
find support in the example of Michigan, where all
the proceedings, stretching through successive years,
began and ended in party. The proposed State Government
was pressed by the Democrats as a <em>party test</em>;
and all who did not embark in it were denounced.
Of the Legislative Council which called the first Constitutional
Convention in 1835, all were Democrats;
and in the Convention itself, composed of eighty-seven
members, only seven were Whigs. The Convention
of 1836 which gave the final assent originated in a
Democratic Convention, on the 29th of October, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
the County of Wayne, composed of one hundred and
twenty-four delegates, all Democrats, who proceeded to
resolve:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the delegates of the <em>Democratic party</em> of Wayne,
solemnly impressed with the spreading evils and dangers
which a refusal to go into the Union has brought upon the
people of Michigan, earnestly recommend meetings to be immediately
convened by their fellow-citizens in every county
of the State, with a view to the expression of their sentiments
in favor of the election and call of another Convention,
in time to secure our admission into the Union before
the first of January next.”</p>

</div>

<p>Shortly afterwards, a committee of five, appointed by
this Convention, all leading Democrats, issued a circular,
“under the authority of the delegates of the County
of Wayne,” recommending that the voters throughout
Michigan should meet and elect delegates to a Convention
to give the necessary assent to the Act of Congress.
In pursuance of this call, the Convention met; and as
it originated in an exclusively party recommendation, so
it was of an exclusively party character. And it was
the action of this Convention that was submitted to
Congress, and, after discussion in both bodies, on solemn
votes, approved.</p>

<p>The precedent of Michigan has another feature, which
is entitled to gravest attention, especially at this moment,
when citizens exerting themselves to establish a
State Government in Kansas are openly arrested on
the charge of treason, and we are startled by tidings of
maddest efforts to press this procedure of preposterous
Tyranny. No such madness prevailed under Andrew
Jackson,&mdash;although, during the long pendency of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span> the
Michigan proceedings, for more than fourteen months,
the Territorial Government was entirely ousted, and
the State Government organized in all its departments.
One hundred and thirty-seven different legislative acts
and resolutions were passed, providing for elections, imposing
taxes, erecting corporations, and organizing courts
of justice, including a Supreme Court and a Court of
Chancery. All process was issued in the name of the
People of the State of Michigan. And yet no attempt
was made to question the legal validity of these proceedings,
whether legislative or judicial. Least of all
did any menial Governor, “dressed in a little brief authority,”
play the fantastic tricks now witnessed in
Kansas; nor did any person wearing the robes of justice
shock high Heaven with the mockery of injustice
now enacted by emissaries of the President in that Territory.
No, Sir: nothing of this kind then occurred.
Andrew Jackson was President.</p>

<p>Again I say, do you require a precedent? I give it.
But I will not stake this cause on any precedent. I
plant it firmly on the fundamental principle of American
Institutions, as embodied in the Declaration of
Independence, by which government is recognized as
deriving its just powers only <em>from the consent of the
governed</em>, who may alter or abolish it, when it becomes
destructive of their rights. In the debate on the Nebraska
Bill, at the overthrow of the Prohibition of Slavery,
the Declaration of Independence was denounced
as “a self-evident lie.” It is only by similar effrontery
that the fundamental principle which sustains the proceedings
in Kansas can be assailed. Nay, more: you
must disown the Declaration of Independence, and
adopt the Circular of the Holy Alliance, which d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>eclares
that “useful or necessary changes in legislation and in
the administration of states <em>ought to emanate only from
the free will and the deliberate and enlightened impulse
of those whom God, has rendered responsible for power</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
Face to face I put the principle of the Declaration of
Independence and the principle of the Holy Alliance,
and bid them grapple. “The one places the remedy in
the hands which <em>feel</em> the disorder; the other places the
remedy in those hands which <em>cause</em> the disorder”; and
when I thus truthfully characterize them, I but adopt
a sententious phrase from the Debates in the Virginia
Convention on the adoption of the National Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
And now these two principles, embodied in the
rival propositions of the Senator from New York and the
Senator from Illinois, must grapple on this floor.</p>

<p>Statesmen and judges, publicists and authors, with
names of authority in American history, espouse and
vindicate the American principle. Hand in hand they
now stand around Kansas, and feel this new State lean
on them for support. I content myself with adducing
two only, both from slaveholding Virginia, in days when
Human Rights were not without support in that State.
Listen to the language of St. George Tucker, the distinguished
commentator upon Blackstone, uttered from
the bench in a judicial opinion.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The power of convening the legal Assemblies, or the
ordinary constitutional Legislature, <em>resided solely in the Executive</em>.
They could neither be chosen without writs issued
by its authority, nor assemble, when chosen, but under the
same authority. The Conventions, on the contrary, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>chosen and assembled either in pursuance of recommendations
from Congress or from their own bodies, <em>or by the discretion
and common consent of the people</em>. They were held
even whilst a legal Assembly existed.&hellip; The Convention,
then, was not the ordinary Legislature of Virginia. It
was the body of the people, impelled to assemble from a
sense of common danger, consulting for the common good,
and acting in all things for the common safety.”<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Listen also to the language of James Madison:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That, in all great changes of established governments,
forms ought to give way to substance; that a rigid adherence
in such cases to the former would render nominal
and nugatory the transcendent and precious right of the
people to ‘abolish or alter their governments as to them
shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.’ &hellip;
Nor could it have been forgotten <em>that no little ill-timed
scruples, no zeal for adhering to ordinary forms, were
anywhere seen, except in those who wished to indulge, under
these masks, their secret enmity to the substance contended
for</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Proceedings thus sustained I am unwilling to call
<em>revolutionary</em>, although this term has the sanction of the
Senator from New York. They are founded on unquestionable
American right, declared with Independence,
confirmed by the blood of the Fathers, and expounded
by patriots, which cannot be impeached without impairing
the liberties of all. On this head the language of
Mr. Buchanan, in reply to Mr. Calhoun, is explicit.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Does the gentleman [Mr. <span class="smcap">Calhoun</span>] contend, then, that,
if, in one of the States of this Union, the Government be so
organized as utterly to destroy the right of equal representation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>there is no mode of obtaining redress, but by an Act
of the Legislature authorizing a Convention, or by open rebellion?
Must the people step at once from oppression to
open war? Must it be either absolute submission or absolute
revolution? <em>Is there no middle course?</em> I cannot agree
with the Senator. I say that the whole history of our Government
establishes the principle that the people are sovereign,
and that a majority of them can alter or change their
fundamental laws at pleasure. <em>I deny that this is either
rebellion or revolution. It is an essential and a recognized
principle in all our forms of government.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Surely, Sir, if ever there was occasion for the exercise
of this right, the time had come in Kansas. The people
there were subjugated by a horde of foreign invaders,
and brought under a tyrannical code of revolting barbarity,
while among them property and life were exposed
to shameless assaults which flaunted at noonday, and to
reptile abuses which crawled in the darkness of night.
<em>Self-defence is the first law of Nature</em>; and unless this
law is temporarily silenced, as all other law is silenced
there, you cannot condemn the proceedings in Kansas.
Here, Sir, is unquestionable authority, <em>in itself an overwhelming
law</em>, which belongs to all countries and times,&mdash;which
is the same in Kansas as at Athens and
Rome,&mdash;which is now, and will be hereafter, as it was
in other days,&mdash;in presence of which Acts of Congress
and Constitutions are powerless as the voice of man
against the thunder which rolls through the sky,&mdash;which
declares itself coëval with life,&mdash;whose very
breath is life itself; and now, in the last resort, do I
place all these proceedings under this supreme safeguard,
which you will assail in vain. Any opposition must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
be founded on absolute perversion of facts, or perversion
of fundamental principles, which no speeches can
uphold, though surpassing in numbers the myriad piles
sunk in the mud to sustain the Dutch Stadthouse at
Amsterdam.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus, on every ground of precedent, whether as regards
population or forms of proceeding,&mdash;also, on the
vital principle of American Institutions,&mdash;and, lastly,
on the supreme law of self-defence, do I now invoke
the power of Congress to admit Kansas at once and
without hesitation into the Union. “New States <em>may</em>
be admitted by the Congress into this Union”: such
are the words of the Constitution. If you hesitate
for want of precedent, then do I appeal to the great
principle of American Institutions. If, forgetting the
origin of the Republic, you turn away from this principle,
then, in the name of human nature, trampled
down and oppressed, but aroused to just self-defence,
do I plead for the exercise of this power. Do not
hearken, I pray you, to the propositions of Tyranny
and Folly; do not be ensnared by that other proposition
of the Senator from Illinois [Mr. <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>],
where is the horrid root of Injustice and Civil War;
but apply gladly, and at once, the True Remedy, where
are Justice and Peace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, an immense space has been traversed,
and I stand now at the goal. The argument in its various
parts is here closed. The Crime against Kansas
has been displayed in its origin and extent, beginning
with the overthrow of the Prohibition of Slavery, next
cropping out in conspiracy on the borders of Missouri,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
then hardening into continuity of outrage through organized
invasion and miscellaneous assaults where all
security was destroyed, and ending at last in the perfect
subjugation of a generous people to an unprecedented
Usurpation. Turning aghast from the Crime,
which, like murder, confesses itself “with most miraculous
organ,” we have looked with mingled shame and
indignation upon the four Apologies, whether of Tyranny,
Imbecility, Absurdity, or Infamy, in which it is
wrapped, marking especially false testimony, congenial
with the original Crime, against the Emigrant Aid
Company. Then were noted, in succession, the four
Remedies, whether of Tyranny, Folly, Injustice and
Civil War, or of Justice and Peace, which last bids
Kansas, in conformity with past precedents and under
exigencies of the hour, for redemption from Usurpation,
to take her place as a State of the Union; and
this is the True Remedy. If in this argument I have
not unworthily vindicated Truth, then have I spoken
according to my desires,&mdash;if imperfectly, then only
according to my powers. But there are other things,
not belonging to the argument, which still press for
utterance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sir, the people of Kansas, bone of your bone and flesh
of your flesh, with the education of freemen and the
rights of American citizens, now stand at your door.
Will you send them away, or bid them enter? Will
you push them back to renew their struggle with a
deadly foe, or will you preserve them in security and
peace? Will you cast them again into the den of Tyranny,
or will you help their despairing efforts to escape?
These questions I put with no common solicitude, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
I feel that on their just determination depend all the
most precious interests of the Republic; and I perceive
too clearly the prejudices in the way, and the
accumulating bitterness against this distant people, now
claiming a simple birthright, while I am bowed with
mortification, as I recognize the President of the United
States, who should have been a staff to the weak and
a shield to the innocent, at the head of this strange
oppression.</p>

<p>At every stage the similitude between the wrongs of
Kansas and those other wrongs against which our fathers
rose becomes more apparent. Read the Declaration
of Independence, and there is hardly an accusation
against the British Monarch which may not now
be hurled with increased force against the American
President. The parallel has fearful particularity. Our
fathers complained, that the King had “sent hither
swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out
their substance,”&mdash;that he had “combined with others
to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution,
<em>giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation</em>,”&mdash;that
he had “abdicated government here, by
declaring us out of his protection, and <em>waging war
against us</em>,”&mdash;that he had “excited domestic insurrections
amongst us, and <em>endeavored to bring on the inhabitants
of our frontiers the merciless savages</em>,”&mdash;that “our
repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated
injury.” And this arraignment was aptly followed by
the damning words, that “a Prince whose character is
thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is
unfit to be the ruler of a free people.” And surely the
President who does all these things cannot be less unfit
than a Prince. At every stage the responsibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
is brought directly to him. His offence is of commission
and omission. He has done that which he ought
not to have done, and has left undone that which he
ought to have done. By his activity the Prohibition
of Slavery was overturned. By his failure to act the
honest emigrants in Kansas are left a prey to wrong
of all kinds. His activity and inactivity are alike fatal.
And now he stands forth the most conspicuous enemy
of that unhappy Territory.</p>

<p>As the tyranny of the British King is all renewed in
the President, so are renewed on this floor the old indignities
which embittered and fomented the troubles
of our fathers. The early petition of the American
Congress to Parliament, long before any suggestion of
Independence, was opposed&mdash;like the petitions of Kansas&mdash;because
that body “was assembled without any
requisition on the part of the Supreme Power.” Another
petition from New York, presented by Edmund
Burke, was flatly rejected, as claiming rights derogatory
to Parliament. And still another petition from Massachusetts
Bay was dismissed as “vexatious and scandalous,”
while the patriot philosopher who bore it was
exposed to peculiar contumely. Throughout the debates
our fathers were made the butt of sorry jest
and supercilious assumption. And now these scenes,
with these precise objections, are renewed in the American
Senate.</p>

<p>With regret I come again upon the Senator from
South Carolina [Mr. <span class="smcap">Butler</span>], who, omnipresent in this
debate,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> overflows with rage at the simple suggestion
that Kansas has applied for admission as a State, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
with incoherent phrase, discharges the loose expectoration
of his speech, now upon her representative, and
then upon her people. There was no extravagance of
the ancient Parliamentary debate which he did not
repeat; nor was there any possible deviation from
truth which he did not make,&mdash;with so much of passion,
I gladly add, as to save him from the suspicion
of intentional aberration. But the Senator touches
nothing which he does not disfigure&mdash;with error,
sometimes of principle, sometimes of fact. He shows
an incapacity of accuracy, whether in stating the Constitution
or in stating the law, whether in details of
statistics or diversions of scholarship. He cannot ope
his mouth, but out there flies a blunder. Surely he
ought to be familiar with the life of Franklin; and
yet he referred to this household character, while acting
as agent of our fathers in England, as above suspicion:
and this was done that he might give point
to a false contrast with the agent of Kansas,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>&mdash;not
knowing, that, however the two may differ in genius
and fame, they are absolutely alike in this experience:
that Franklin, when intrusted with the petition of Massachusetts
Bay, was assaulted by a foul-mouthed speaker
where he could not be heard in defence, and denounced
as “thief,” even as the agent of Kansas is
assaulted on this floor, and denounced as “forger.”
And let not the vanity of the Senator be inspired by
parallel with the British statesmen of that day; for
it is only in hostility to Freedom that any parallel
can be found.</p>

<p>But it is against the people of Kansas that the sensibilities
of the Senator are particularly aroused. Coming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
as he announces, “from a State,”&mdash;ay, Sir, from
South Carolina,&mdash;he turns with lordly disgust from this
newly formed community, which he will not recognize
even as “a member of the body politic.”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Pray, Sir, by
what title does he indulge in this egotism? Has he read
the history of the “State” which he represents? He
cannot, surely, forget its shameful imbecility from Slavery,
confessed throughout the Revolution, followed by
its more shameful assumptions for Slavery since. He
cannot forget its wretched persistence in the slave-trade,
as the very apple of its eye, and the condition of its
participation in the Union. He cannot forget its Constitution,
which is republican only in name, confirming
power in the hands of the few, and founding the qualifications
of its legislators on “a settled freehold estate
of five hundred acres of land <em>and</em> ten negroes.”<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> And
yet the Senator to whom this “State” has in part committed
the guardianship of its good name, instead of
moving with backward-treading steps to cover its nakedness,
rushes forward, in the very ecstasy of madness,
to expose it, by provoking comparison with Kansas.
South Carolina is old; Kansas is young. South Carolina
counts by centuries, where Kansas counts by years.
But a beneficent example may be born in a day; and I
venture to declare, that against the two centuries of
the older “State” may be set already the two years
of trial, evolving corresponding virtue, in the younger
community. In the one is the long wail of Slavery;
in the other, the hymn of Freedom. And if we glance
at special achievement, it will be difficult to fin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>d anything
in the history of South Carolina which presents
so much of heroic spirit in an heroic cause as shines
in that repulse of the Missouri invaders by the beleaguered
town of Lawrence, where even the women gave
their effective efforts to Freedom. The matrons of Rome
who poured their jewels into the treasury for the public
defence, the wives of Prussia who with delicate fingers
clothed their defenders against French invasion, the
mothers of our own Revolution who sent forth their sons
covered over with prayers and blessings to combat for
Human Rights, did nothing of self-sacrifice truer than
did these women on this occasion. Were the whole
history of South Carolina blotted out of existence, from
its very beginning down to the day of the last election
of the Senator to his present seat on this floor, civilization
might lose&mdash;I do not say how little, but surely
less than it has already gained by the example of Kansas,
in that valiant struggle against oppression, and in
the development of a new science of emigration. Already
in Lawrence alone are newspapers and schools,
including a High School,&mdash;and throughout this infant
Territory there is more of educated talent, in proportion
to its inhabitants, than in his vaunted “State.” Ah,
Sir, I tell the Senator, that Kansas, welcomed as a Free
State, “a ministering angel shall be” to the Republic,
when South Carolina, in the cloak of darkness which

<p>The Senator from Illinois [Mr. <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>] naturally
joins the Senator from South Carolina, and gives to
this warfare the superior intensity of his nature. He
thinks that the National Government has not completely
proved its power, as it has never hanged a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
traitor,&mdash;but, if occasion requires, he hopes there will
be no hesitation; and this threat is directed at Kansas,
and even at the friends of Kansas throughout the
country. Again occurs a parallel with the struggles
of our fathers; and I borrow the language of Patrick
Henry, when, to the cry from the Senator of “Treason!
treason!” I reply, “If this be treason, make the most
of it.” Sir, it is easy to call names; but I beg to tell
the Senator, that, if the word “traitor” is in any way
applicable to those who reject a tyrannical Usurpation,
whether in Kansas or elsewhere, then must some new
word, of deeper color, be invented to designate those
mad spirits who would endanger and degrade the Republic,
while they betray all the cherished sentiments
of the Fathers and the spirit of the Constitution, that
Slavery may have new spread. Let the Senator proceed.
Not the first time in history will a scaffold become
the pedestal of honor. Out of death comes life,
and the “traitor” whom he blindly executes will live
immortal in the cause.</p>

<p>Among these hostile Senators is yet another, with
all the prejudices of the Senator from South Carolina,
but without his generous impulses, who, from his character
before the country, and the rancor of his opposition,
deserves to be named: I mean the Senator from
Virginia [Mr. <span class="smcap">Mason</span>], who, as author of the Fugitive
Slave Bill, has associated himself with a special act of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
inhumanity and tyranny. Of him I shall say little, for
he has said little in this debate, though within that little
was compressed the bitterness of a life absorbed in support
of Slavery. He holds the commission of Virginia;
but he does not represent that early Virginia, so dear
to our hearts, which gave to us the pen of Jefferson, by
which the equality of men was declared, and the sword
of Washington, by which Independence was secured:
he represents that other Virginia, from which Washington
and Jefferson avert their faces, where human
beings are bred as cattle for the shambles, and a dungeon
rewards the pious matron who teaches little children
to relieve their bondage by reading the Book of
Life.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> It is proper that such a Senator, representing
such a State, should rail against Free Kansas.</p>

<p>Such as these are natural enemies of Kansas, and I
introduce them with reluctance, simply that the country
may understand the character of the hostility to
be overcome. Arrayed with them are all who unite,
under any pretext or apology, in propagandism of Human
Slavery. To such, indeed, time-honored safeguards
of popular rights can be a name and nothing more.
What are trial by jury, <i>Habeas Corpus</i>, ballot-box, right
of petition, liberty in Kansas, your liberty, Sir, or mine,
to one who lends himself, not merely to the support at
home, but to propagandism abroad, of that preposterous
wrong which denies even the right of a man to himself?
Such a cause can be maintained only by the practical
subversion of all rights. It is, therefore, merely according
to reason that its partisans should uphold the
Usurpation in Kansas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<p>To overthrow this Usurpation is now the special, importunate
duty of Congress, admitting of no hesitation
or postponement. To this end must it ascend from the
cabals of candidates, the machinations of party, and the
low level of vulgar strife. Especially must it turn from
that Slave Oligarchy now controlling the Republic, and
refuse to be its tool. Let its power be stretched forth
into this distant Territory, not to bind, but to release,&mdash;not
for oppression of the weak, but for subversion of
the tyrannical,&mdash;not for prop and maintenance of revolting
Usurpation, but for confirmation of Liberty.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Let it now take stand between the living and dead,
and cause this plague to be stayed. All this it can
do; and if the interests of Slavery were not hostile, all
this it would do at once, in reverent regard for justice,
law, and order, driving far away all alarms of war; nor
would it dare to brave the shame and punishment
of this “Great Refusal.”<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> But the Slave Power dares
anything; and it can be conquered only by the united
masses of the People. From Congress to the People
I appeal.</p>

<p>Already Public Opinion gathers unwonted forces to
scourge the aggressors. In the press, in daily conversation,
wherever two or three are gathered together, there
the indignant utterance finds vent. And trade, by unerring
indications, attests the growing energy. Public
credit in Missouri droops. The six per cents of that
State, which at par should be 102, have sunk to 84,&mdash;thus
at once completing the evidence of Crime, and attesting
its punishment. Business is now turning from
the Assassins and Thugs that infest the Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>ouri River,
to seek some safer avenue. And this, though not unimportant
in itself, is typical of greater change. The
political credit of the men who uphold the Usurpation
droops even more than the stocks; and the People are
turning from all those through whom the Assassins and
Thugs derive their disgraceful immunity.</p>

<p>It was said of old, “Cursed be he that removeth his
neighbor’s Landmark. <em>And all the people shall say,
Amen.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> “Cursed,” it is said, “in the city and in
the field; cursed in basket and store; cursed when thou
comest in, and cursed when thou goest out.”<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> These are
terrible imprecations; but if ever any Landmark were
sacred, it was that by which an immense territory was
guarded <em>forever</em> against Slavery; and if ever such imprecations
could justly descend upon any one, they must
descend now upon all who, not content with the removal
of this sacred Landmark, have since, with criminal
complicity, fostered the incursions of the great Wrong
against which it was intended to guard. But I utter no
imprecations. These are not my words; nor is it my
part to add to or subtract from them. But, thanks be
to God! they find response in the hearts of an aroused
People, making them turn from every man, whether
President or Senator or Representative, engaged in this
Crime,&mdash;especially from those who, cradled in free institutions,
are without the apology of education or social
prejudice,&mdash;until upon all such those other words of
the Prophet shall be fulfilled: “I will set my face
against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb,
and I will cut him off from the midst of my people.”<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
Turning thus from the authors of this Crime,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
the People will unite once more with the Fathers of
the Republic in just condemnation of Slavery, determined
especially that it shall find no home in the National
territories, while the Slave Power, in which the
Crime had its beginning, and by which it is now sustained,
will be swept into the charnel-house of defunct
Tyrannies.</p>

<p>In this contest Kansas bravely stands forth, the stripling
leader, clad in the panoply of American Institutions.
Calmly meeting and adopting a frame of government,
her people with intuitive promptitude perform
the duties of freemen; and when I consider the
difficulties by which she is beset, I find dignity in her
attitude. <em>Offering herself for admission into the Union
as a</em> <span class="smcap">Free State</span>, <em>she presents a single issue for the people
to decide</em>. And since the Slave Power now stakes on
this issue all its ill-gotten supremacy, the People, while
vindicating Kansas, will at the same time overthrow
this Tyranny. Thus the contest which she begins involves
Liberty not only for herself, but for the whole
country. God be praised that Kansas does not bend ignobly
beneath the yoke! Far away on the prairies, she
is now battling for the Liberty of all, against the President,
who misrepresents all. Everywhere among those
not insensible to Right, the generous struggle meets a
generous response. From innumerable throbbing hearts
go forth the very words of encouragement which in the
sorrowful days of our fathers were sent by Virginia,
speaking by the pen of Richard Henry Lee, to Massachusetts,
in the person of her popular tribune, Samuel
Adams:&mdash;</p>

<p>In all this sympathy there is strength. But in the

great spirits of History combat by the side of the people
of Kansas, breathing divine courage. Above all towers
the majestic form of Washington, once more, as on the
bloody field, bidding them remember those rights of
Human Nature for which the War of Independence was
waged. Such a cause, thus sustained, is invincible.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The contest, which, beginning in Kansas, reaches us
will be transferred soon from Congress to that broader
stage, where every citizen is not only spectator, but
actor; and to their judgment I confidently turn. To
the People, about to exercise the electoral franchise,
in choosing a Chief Magistrate of the Republic, I appeal,
to vindicate the electoral franchise in Kansas.
Let the ballot-box of the Union, with multitudinous
might, protect the ballot-box in that Territory. Let the
voters everywhere, while rejoicing in their own rights,
help guard the equal rights of distant fellow-citizens,
that the shrines of popular institutions, now desecrated,
may be sanctified anew,&mdash;that the ballot-box, now
plundered, may be restored,&mdash;and that the cry, “I am an
American citizen,” shall no longer be impotent against
outrage. In just regard for free labor, which you woul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>d
blast by deadly contact with slave labor,&mdash;in Christian
sympathy with the slave, whom you would task
and sell,&mdash;in stern condemnation of the Crime consummated
on that beautiful soil,&mdash;in rescue of fellow-citizens,
now subjugated to Tyrannical Usurpation,&mdash;in
dutiful respect for the early Fathers, whose aspirations
are ignobly thwarted,&mdash;in the name of the Constitution
outraged, of the Laws trampled down, of
Justice banished, of Humanity degraded, of Peace destroyed,
of Freedom crushed to earth,&mdash;and in the
name of the Heavenly Father, whose service is perfect
Freedom, I make this last appeal.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner spoke for two days. As soon as he took his seat, the
storm which had been preparing broke forth. Mr. Cass was the first
to speak. He began by saying that he had “listened with equal regret
and surprise” to the speech of Mr. Sumner, which he characterized as
“the most un-American and unpatriotic that ever grated on the ears
of the members of this high body.” Mr. Douglas followed in a tirade
of personality, in which he renewed the old assault of two years before,
charging Mr. Sumner with defying the Constitution, when he exclaimed
with regard to the rendition of a fugitive slave, “Is thy servant a dog,
that he should do this thing?”<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The speech of Mr. Sumner was characterized
in the most offensive terms. “He seems to get up a speech
as in Yankee-land they get up a bed-quilt.” Then again: “Is it
his object to provoke some of us to kick him as we would a dog in
the street, that he may get sympathy upon the just chastisement?”
Then again: “We have had another dish of the classics served up,&mdash;classic
allusions, each one only distinguished for its lasciviousness and
obscenity,&mdash;each one drawn from those portions of the classics which
all decent professors in respectable colleges cause to be suppressed, as
unfit for decent young men to read. Sir, I cannot repeat the words.
I should be condemned as unworthy of entering decent society, if I repeated
those obscene, vulgar terms which have been used at least a
hundred times in that speech.” Then, further, he said that “the Senator
from Massachusetts had his speech written, printed, commit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>ted to
memory, practised every night before the glass, with a negro boy to
hold the candle and watch the gestures, and annoying the boarders in
the adjoining rooms until they were forced to quit the house.” All this
was uttered with the sympathy of the slave-masters about him.</p>

<p>Mr. Mason followed with a bitterness which seemed a prolongation
of the debate two years before. The tone of his speech appears in these
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The necessities of our political position bring us into relations and associations
upon this floor, which, in obedience to a common government, we
are forced to admit. They bring us into relations and associations which
beyond the walls of this Chamber we are enabled to avoid,&mdash;associations
here whose presence elsewhere is dishonor, and the touch of whose hand
would be a disgrace.&hellip;</p>

<p>“I have said that the necessity of political position alone brings me into
relations with men upon this floor who elsewhere I cannot acknowledge as
possessing manhood in any form. I am constrained to hear here depravity,
vice in its most odious form uncoiled in this presence, exhibiting its loathsome
deformities in accusation and vilification against the quarter of the
country from which I come; and I must listen to it because it is a necessity
of my position, under a common government, to recognize as an equal politically
one whom to see elsewhere is to shun and despise.”</p>

</div>

<p>This debate, which was much in harmony with that of June, 1854,
showed a state of feeling bordering on violence. The language of Mr.
Douglas seemed to invite it, especially when he asked, “Is it his object
to provoke some of us to kick him as we would a dog in the street, that
he may get sympathy upon the just chastisement?” It came soon.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner followed in unpremeditated remarks, replying to the
only point of argument, and giving expression to the indignant sentiments
inspired by the attack. These are preserved here as belonging
to the history of this occasion.</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;Three Senators have spoken:
one venerable in years, with whom I have had
associations of personal regard longer than with anybody
now within the sound of my voice,&mdash;the Senator
from Michigan [Mr. <span class="smcap">Cass</span>]; another, the Senator from
Illinois [Mr. <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>]; and a third, the Senator from
Virginia [Mr. <span class="smcap">Mason</span>].</p>

<p>The Senator from Michigan knows well that nothing
I say can have anything but kindness for him. He <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>has
declared on this floor to-day that he listened with regret
to my speech. I have never avowed on this floor how
often, with heart brimming full of friendship for him, I
have listened with regret to what has fallen from his
lips. I have never said that he stood here to utter sentiments
which seemed beyond all question disloyal to
the character of the Fathers and to the true spirit of the
Constitution; but this, with his permission, and in all
kindness, I do now say to him.</p>

<p>The Senator proceeded very briefly and in a cursory
manner to criticise my statement of the Michigan case.
Sir, my statement was founded on the actual documents.
No word was mine: it was all from Jackson, from Grundy,
from Buchanan, from Benton, from the Democratic
leaders of that day. When the Senator criticised me,
his shaft did not touch me, but fell upon them. And
here I leave the Senator from Michigan.</p>

<p>To the Senator from Illinois I should willingly yield
the privilege of the common scold,&mdash;the last word;
but I will not yield to him, in any discussion with me,
the last argument, or the last semblance of it. He has
crowned the outrage of this debate by venturing to rise
here and calumniate me. He has said that I came here,
took an oath to support the Constitution, and yet determined
not to support a particular clause in that Constitution.
To that statement I give, to his face, the flattest
denial. When it was made previously on this floor by
the absent Senator from South Carolina [Mr. <span class="smcap">Butler</span>],
I then repelled it: you shall see how explicitly and
completely. I read from the debate of the 28th of June,
1854, as published in the “Globe.” Here is what I
answered to the Senator from South Carolina:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This Senator was disturbed, when, to his inquiry, personally,
pointedly, and vehemently addressed to me, whether
I would join in returning a fellow-man to Slavery, I exclaimed:
‘Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this
thing?’”</p>

</div>

<p>You will observe that the inquiry of the Senator
was, whether I would join in returning my fellow-man
to slavery? It was not, whether I would support any
clause of the Constitution of the United States?&mdash;far
from that. I then proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In fitful phrase, which seemed to come from unconscious
excitement, so common with the Senator, he shot forth various
cries about ‘dogs,’ and, among other things, asked if
there was any ‘dog’ in the Constitution? The Senator did
not seem to bear in mind, through the heady currents of
that moment, that, by the false interpretation he fastens
upon the Constitution,”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>and in which the Senator from Illinois now joins,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“he has helped to nurture there a whole kennel of Carolina
bloodhounds, trained, with savage jaw and insatiable scent,
for the hunt of flying bondmen. No, Sir, I do not believe
that there is any ‘kennel of bloodhounds,’ or even any
‘dog,’ in the Constitution.”</p>

</div>

<p>I said further:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Since I have been charged with openly declaring a
purpose to violate the Constitution, and to break the oath
which I have taken at that desk, I shall be pardoned for
showing simply how a few plain words will put all this
down.”</p>

</div>

<p>I next proceeded to cite the memorable veto by President
Jackson, in 1832, of the Bank of the United States.
It will be remembered that to his course at that cr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>itical
time were opposed the authority of the Supreme Court
and his oath to support the Constitution,&mdash;precisely as
the Senator from Illinois now, with ignorance, or with
want of logic greater than his ignorance, undertakes to
revile me. Here is the triumphant reply of President
Jackson:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If the opinion of the Supreme Court covered the whole
ground of this Act, it ought not to control the coördinate authorities
of this Government. The Congress, the Executive,
and the Court must, each for itself, be guided by its own
opinion of the Constitution. <em>Each public officer, who takes an
oath to support the Constitution, swears that he will support it
as he understands it, and not as it is understood by others.</em> It
is as much the duty of the House of Representatives, of the
Senate, and of the President, to decide upon the constitutionality
of any bill or resolution which may be presented to
them for passage or approval, as it is of the Supreme Judges,
when it may be brought before them for judicial decision.&hellip;
The authority of the Supreme Court must not, therefore,
be permitted to control the Congress or the Executive,
when acting in their legislative capacities, but to have
only such influence as the force of their reasoning may deserve.”</p>

</div>

<p>After this passage from General Jackson I proceeded
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“In swearing to support the Constitution at your desk,
Mr. President, I did not swear to support it as <em>you</em> understand
it,&mdash;oh, no, Sir!&mdash;or as the Senator from Virginia
understands it,&mdash;by no means!&mdash;or as the Senator from
South Carolina understands it, with a kennel of bloodhounds,
or at least a ‘dog’ in it, ‘pawing to get free his hinder
parts,’ in pursuit of a slave. No such thing. Sir, I swore
to support the Constitution <em>as I understand it</em>,&mdash;nor more,
nor less.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then explaining at some length my understanding of
the clause, I concluded on this point in these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I desire to say, that, as I understand the Constitution, this
clause does not impose upon me, as Senator or citizen, any
obligation to take part, directly or indirectly, in the surrender
of a fugitive slave.”</p>

</div>

<p>Yet, in the face of all this, which occurred in open
debate on the floor of the Senate, which is here in the
records of the country, and has been extensively circulated,
quoted, discussed, criticised, the Senator from
Illinois, in the swiftness of his audacity, presumes to
assail me. Perhaps I had better leave that Senator
without a word more; but this is not the first, or the
second, or the third, or the fourth time that he has
launched against me his personalities. Sir, if this be
agreeable to him, I make no complaint,&mdash;though, for
the sake of truth and the amenities of debate, I could
wish that he had directed his assaults upon my arguments;
but since he has presumed to touch me, he
will not complain, if I administer to him a word of
advice.</p>

<p>Sir, this is the Senate of the United States, an important
body under the Constitution, with great powers.
Its members are justly supposed, from years, to be above
the intemperance of youth, and from character to be
above the gusts of vulgarity. They are supposed to
have something of wisdom and something of that candor
which is the handmaid of wisdom. Let the Senator
bear these things in mind, and remember hereafter that
the bowie-knife and bludgeon are not proper emblems
of senatorial debate. Let him remember that the swa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>gger
of Bob Acres and the ferocity of the Malay cannot
add dignity to this body. The Senator infused into
his speech the venom sweltering for months,&mdash;ay, for
years; and he has alleged matters entirely without
foundation, in order to heap upon me some personal
obloquy. I will not descend to things which dropped
so naturally from his tongue. I only brand them to
his face as false. I say also to that Senator, and I
wish him to bear it in mind, that no person with the
upright form of man can be allowed&mdash;&mdash; [<em>Hesitation.</em>]</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Douglas.</span> Say it.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I will say it,&mdash;no person with the upright
form of man can be allowed, without violation of
all decency, to switch out from his tongue the perpetual
stench of offensive personality. Sir, that is not a proper
weapon of debate, at least on this floor. The noisome,
squat, and nameless animal to which I now refer is not
the proper model for an American Senator. Will the
Senator from Illinois take notice?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Douglas.</span> I will,&mdash;and therefore will not imitate
you, Sir.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I did not hear the Senator.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Douglas.</span> I said, if that be the case, I would certainly
never imitate you in that capacity,&mdash;recognizing
the force of the illustration.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Mr. President, again the Senator
switches his tongue, and again he fills the Senate
with its offensive odor. But I drop the Senator.</p>

<p>There was still another, the Senator from Virginia,
who is now also in my eye. That Senator said nothing
of argument, and therefore there is nothing of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
to be answered. I simply say to him that hard words
are not argument, frowns are not reasons, nor do scowls
belong to the proper arsenal of parliamentary debate.
The Senator has not forgotten that on a former occasion
I did something to exhibit the plantation manners which
he displays. I will not do any more now.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>



<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX.</h2>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>On the second day after the Speech an event occurred which
aroused the country, and was characterized at the time by
an eminent English statesman, Sir George Cornewall Lewis, as
“the beginning of civil war.” Mr. Sumner was sitting at his
desk in the Senate Chamber shortly after the adjournment of the
Senate, when he was attacked by the Hon. Preston S. Brooks, a
Representative of South Carolina, and by a succession of blows
on the head with a bludgeon rendered senseless. As confederates
with Mr. Brooks were Hon. Lawrence M. Keitt, a Representative
of South Carolina, and Hon. Henry A. Edmundson, a Representative
of Virginia, who stood at some distance, evidently to sustain
the assault. Mr. Sumner sunk upon the floor of the Senate
Chamber. After some time he was carried to an adjoining room,
where his wounds were dressed, and he was then taken to his
lodgings.</p>

<p>The newspapers of the time attest the profound and wide-spread
excitement. The titles of the articles are suggestive. “The Attempt
to murder Mr. Sumner,”&mdash;“Ruffianism National,”&mdash;“Blood
in the Senate,”&mdash;“Outrageous Assault on Senator Sumner,”&mdash;“Brutal
and Cowardly Assault upon Charles Sumner,”&mdash;“Ruffianism
in Washington,”&mdash;“A Crisis at Hand,”&mdash;“The
Outrage on Mr. Sumner,”&mdash;“Atrocious Outrage,”&mdash;“Disgraceful
Assault upon a Senator,”&mdash;“Another Outrage upon Massachusetts,”&mdash;“A
Border Ruffian in the Senate,”&mdash;“The Last
Argument of Slavery,”&mdash;“Barbarism at the Capitol,”&mdash;“Shame!
Shame!” Such were the general voices. The article in the
<i>National Intelligencer</i> at Washington was entitled “Painful Occurrence.”</p>

<h3>I.<br />
THE ASSAULT.</h3>

<p>On Friday, May 23, the day after the assault, Hon. Henry
Wilson, colleague of Mr. Sumner, rising in his seat immediately
after the reading of the Journal, made the following remarks.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;The seat of my colleague is vacant to-day.
That seat is vacant to-day for the first time during five years of public
service. Yesterday, after a touching tribute of respect to the memory
of a deceased member of the House of Representatives, the Senate adjourned.
My colleague remained in his seat, busily engaged in his
public duties. While thus engaged, with pen in hand, and in a position
which rendered him utterly incapable of protecting or defending
himself, Mr. Preston S. Brooks, a member of the House of Representatives,
approached his desk unobserved, and abruptly addressed
him. Before he had time to utter a single word in reply, he received
a stunning blow upon the head from a cane in the hands of Mr.
Brooks, which made him blind and almost unconscious. Endeavoring,
however, to protect himself, in rising from his chair his desk was
overthrown; and while in that condition, he was beaten upon the
head by repeated blows, until he sunk upon the floor of the Senate,
exhausted, unconscious, and covered with his own blood. He was
taken from this Chamber to the anteroom, his wounds were dressed,
and then by friends he was carried to his home and placed upon his
bed. He is unable to be with us to-day to perform the duties that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>belong to him as a member of this body.</p>

<p>“Sir, to assail a member of the Senate out of this Chamber, ‘for
words spoken in debate,’ is a grave offence, not only against the rights
of the Senator, but the constitutional privileges of this House; but,
Sir, to come into this Chamber, and assault a member in his seat until
he falls exhausted and senseless on this floor, is an offence requiring
the prompt and decisive action of the Senate.</p>

<p>“Senators, I have called your attention to this transaction. I submit
no motion. I leave it to older Senators, whose character, whose
position in this body and before the country, eminently fit them for
the task of devising measures to redress the wrongs of a member of this
body, and to vindicate the honor and dignity of the Senate.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Seward followed with a resolution.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That a Committee of five members be appointed by
the President to inquire into the circumstances attending the assault
committed on the person of the Hon. Charles Sumner, a member of
the Senate, in the Senate Chamber yesterday; and that the said Committee
be instructed to report a statement of the facts, together with
their opinion thereon to the Senate.”</p>

</div>

<p>On motion of Mr. Mason, of Virginia, the resolution was
amended, so that the Committee should be elected by the Senate.
It was then adopted. Mr. Pearce, of Maryland, Mr. Allen, of
Rhode Island, Mr. Dodge, of Wisconsin, Mr. Geyer, of Missouri,
and Mr. Cass, of Michigan, were elected. Mr. Seward, who introduced
the resolution, and Mr. Wilson, who announced the assault,
were excluded.</p>

<p>On the 28th of May Mr. Pearce made a report from the Select
Committee, which, after a brief statement of facts, says, that
“the Senate, for a breach of its privileges, cannot arrest a member
of the House of Representatives, and, <i>a fortiori</i>, cannot try
and punish him”; that “that authority devolves solely upon the
House of which he is a member”; and that “the Senate cannot
proceed further than to make complaint to the House of
Representatives of the assault committed by one of its members.”
It was ordered that “a copy of this report, and the affidavits
accompanying the same, be transmitted to the House of Representatives.”</p>

<p>Nothing further was done in the Senate on this matter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>
<p>In the House of Representatives, on the day after the assault,
Hon. Lewis D. Campbell, of Ohio, moved a Select Committee of
five “to investigate the subject, and to report the facts, with such
resolutions in reference thereto as in their judgments may be
proper and necessary for the vindication of the character of the
House.” The resolution was adopted, and the following Committee
was appointed by the Speaker: Lewis D. Campbell, of
Ohio, John Allison, of Pennsylvania, Howell Cobb, of Georgia,
Alfred B. Greenwood, of Arkansas, and Francis E. Spinner, of
New York. Alexander C. M. Pennington, of New Jersey, was
substituted for Mr. Allison. To this Committee were referred the
proceedings of the Senate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the testimony taken and reported by the Committee will be
found an authentic account of the assault. The Committee visited
Mr. Sumner at his house.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hon. Charles Sumner</span>, being sworn, testified.</p>

<p>“<i>Question</i> (by Mr. Campbell). What do you know of the facts connected
with the assault alleged to have been made upon you in the
Senate Chamber by Hon. Mr. Brooks, of South Carolina, on Thursday,
May 22, 1856?</p>

<p>“<i>Answer.</i> I attended the Senate as usual on Thursday, the 22d of
May. After some formal business, a message was received from the
House of Representatives, announcing the death of a member of that
body from Missouri. This was followed by a brief tribute to the deceased
from Mr. Geyer, of Missouri, when, according to usage, and out
of respect to the deceased, the Senate adjourned.</p>

<p>“Instead of leaving the Chamber with the rest on the adjournment,
I continued in my seat, occupied with my pen. While thus intent, in
order to be in season for the mail, which was soon to close, I was approached
by several persons who desired to speak with me; but I answered
them promptly and briefly, excusing myself, for the reason that
I was much engaged. When the last of these left me, I drew my arm-chair
close to my desk, and, with my legs under the desk, continued
writing. My attention at this time was so entirely withdrawn from all
other objects, that, though there must have been many persons on the
floor of the Senate, I saw nobody.</p>

<p>“While thus intent, with my head bent over my writing, I was addressed
by a person who had approached the front of my desk so entirely
unobserved that I was not aware of his presence until I heard
my name pronounced. As I looked up, with pen in hand, I saw a tall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>man, whose countenance was not familiar, standing directly over me,
and at the same moment caught these words: ‘I have read your
speech twice over carefully. It is a libel on South Carolina, and Mr.
Butler, who is a relative of mine&mdash;&mdash;’ While these words were still
passing from his lips, he commenced a succession of blows with a heavy
cane on my bare head, by the first of which I was stunned so as to lose
sight. I no longer saw my assailant, nor any person or object in the
room. What I did afterwards was done almost unconsciously, acting
under the instinct of self-defence. With head already bent down, I
rose from my seat, wrenching up my desk, which was screwed to the
floor, and then pressed forward, while my assailant continued his
blows. I have no other consciousness until I found myself ten feet
forward, in front of my desk, lying on the floor of the Senate, with my
bleeding head supported on the knee of a gentleman, whom I soon
recognized, by voice and countenance, as Mr. Morgan, of New York.
Other persons there were about me offering me friendly assistance; but
I did not recognize any of them. Others there were at a distance, looking
on and offering no assistance, of whom I recognized only Mr. Douglas,
of Illinois, Mr. Toombs, of Georgia, and I thought also my assailant,
standing between them.</p>

<p>“I was helped from the floor and conducted into the lobby of the
Senate, where I was placed upon a sofa. Of those who helped me to
this place I have no recollection. As I entered the lobby, I recognized
Mr. Slidell, of Louisiana, who retreated; but I recognized no one
else until some time later, as I supposed, when I felt a friendly grasp
of the hand, which seemed to come from Mr. Campbell, of Ohio. I
have a vague impression that Mr. Bright, President of the Senate,
spoke to me while I was lying on the floor of the Senate or in the
lobby.</p>

<p>“I make this statement in answer to the interrogatory of the Committee,
and offer it as presenting completely all my recollections of
the assault and of the attending circumstances, whether immediately
before or immediately after. I desire to add, that, besides the words
which I have given as uttered by my assailant, I have an indistinct
recollection of the words, ‘old man’; but these are so enveloped in
the mist which ensued from the first blow, that I am not sure whether
they were uttered or not.</p>

<p>“<i>Ques.</i> (by Mr. Greenwood). How long do you suppose it was after
the adjournment of the Senate before this occurrence took place?</p>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> I am very much at a loss to say whether it was half an
hour or fifteen minutes: I should say ranging from fifteen minutes to
half an hour, more or less; perhaps not more than fifteen minutes. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>have already testified that I was so much absorbed with what I was
doing at my desk, that I took very little note of anything, not even of
time.</p>

<p>“<i>Ques.</i> (by Mr. Cobb). Was the first blow you received from Mr.
Brooks before he had finished the sentence?</p>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> I have no recollection beyond what I have stated.</p>

<p>“<i>Ques.</i> My question was, whether a blow was struck before Mr.
Brooks finished the remark to you which you have just quoted?</p>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> The blow came down with the close of the sentence.</p>

<p>“<i>Ques.</i> Then the sentence was closed before the blow was struck?</p>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> It seemed to me that the blow came in the middle of an
unfinished sentence. In the statement I have made I used the language,
‘While these words were still passing from his lips, he commenced
a succession of blows.’ I heard distinctly the words I have
given; I heard the words ‘a relative of mine,’ and then it seemed to
me there was a break, and I have left it as an unfinished sentence, the
sequel of which I did not hear on account of the blows.</p>

<p>“<i>Ques.</i> (by Mr. Campbell). Did you, at any time between the delivery
of your speech referred to and the time when you were attacked,
receive any intimation, in writing or otherwise, that Mr. Brooks intended
to attack you?</p>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> Never, directly or indirectly; nor had I the most remote
suspicion of any attack, nor was I in any way prepared for an attack.
I had no arms or means of defence of any kind. I was, in fact,
entirely defenceless at the time, except so far as my natural strength
went. In other words, I had no arms either about my person or
in my desk. Nor did I ever wear arms in my life. I have always
lived in a civilized community, where wearing arms has not been
considered necessary. When I had finished my speech on Tuesday,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
I think it was, my colleague came to me and said, ‘I am going home
with you to-day; several of us are going home with you.’ Said I,
‘None of that, Wilson.’ And instead of waiting for him, or allowing
him to accompany me home, I shot off just as I should any other
day. While on my way from the Capitol, I overtook Mr. Seward, with
whom I had engaged to dine. We walked together as far as the
omnibuses. He then proposed that we should take an omnibus,
which I declined, stating that I must go to the printing-office to
look over proofs. I therefore walked alone, overtaking one or two
persons on the way. I have referred to this remark of my colleague
in answer to your question, whether I had in any way been put on my
guard?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>

<p>“<i>Ques.</i> (by Mr. Cobb). What do you attribute the remark of your
colleague to? In other words, was it founded upon an apprehension
growing out of what you had said in your speech?</p>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> I understand that it was. He has told me since that a
member of the House had put him on his guard, but he did not mention
it to me at the time. I suspected no danger, and therefore I
treated what he said to me as trifling.</p>

<p>“<i>Ques.</i> (by Mr. Pennington). Have you ever defied or invited
violence?</p>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> Never, at any time.</p>

<p>“<i>Ques.</i> State what was the condition of your clothing after this
violence, when you were taken from the Chamber.</p>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> I was in such a condition at the time that I was unaware
of the blood on my clothes. I know little about it until after I reached
my room, when I took my clothes off. The shirt, around the neck and
collar, was soaked with blood. The waistcoat had many marks of
blood upon it; also the trousers. The broadcloth coat was covered
with blood on the shoulders so thickly that the blood had soaked
through the cloth, even through the padding, and appeared on the
inside; there was also a great deal of blood on the back of the coat and
its sides.</p>

<p>“<i>Ques.</i> Were you aware of the intention of Mr. Brooks to strike
or inflict a blow before the blow was felt?</p>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> I had not the remotest suspicion of it until I felt the blow
on my head.</p>

<p>“<i>Ques.</i> (by Mr. Campbell). Do you know how often you were
struck?</p>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> I have not the most remote idea.</p>

<p>“<i>Ques.</i> How many wounds have you upon your head?</p>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> I have two principal wounds upon my head, and several
bruises on my hands and arms. The doctor will describe them more
particularly than I am able to.</p>

<p>“<i>Ques.</i> (by Mr. Cobb). You stated, that, when Mr. Brooks approached
you, he remarked that he had read your speech, and it was a
libel upon his State and upon his relative. I will ask you, if you had,
prior to that assault, in any speech, made any personal allusions to
Mr. Brooks’s relative, Mr. Butler, or to the State of South Carolina,
to which Mr. Brooks applied this remark?</p>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> At the time my assailant addressed me I did not know who
he was, least of all did I suppose him to be a relative of Mr. Butler.
In a speech recently made in the Senate I have alluded to the State
of South Carolina, and to Mr. Butler; but I have never said anything
which was not in just response to his speeches, according to parliamentary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>usage, nor anything which can be called a libel upon South
Carolina or Mr. Butler.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon. Henry Wilson</span>, the colleague of Mr. Sumner, first heard
of the assault as he was passing down the street, and hastened
back. As to threats of violence before the assault, he testified:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I know of none, of my own knowledge. Mr. Bingham, of the House
of Representatives, said to me just about the time the Senate adjourned:
‘You had better go down with Mr. Sumner; I think there
will be an assault upon him.’ Said I, ‘Do you think so?’ He said,
‘I have heard remarks made from which I think an assault will be
made.’ I afterwards said to Mr. Sumner that I would like to talk
with him, and I spoke to Mr. Burlingame and to Mr. Colfax to walk
down with us. While I was standing talking to Mr. Burlingame, Mr.
Sumner went to Mr. Sutton’s<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> desk, and then went out of the side
door. I waited, supposing he would come back and go down with us.
But he did not come, and we left the Capitol, but waited some time
near the porter’s lodge, until we heard he had gone home. That is all
I know, and it is merely hearsay. I gave myself little trouble about
it. I went up to his room afterwards, but did not find him at home.
Mr. Sumner paid no attention to what I said. I merely said I wanted
to walk down with him,&mdash;that I wanted to talk with him.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon. John A. Bingham</span>, of Ohio, being sworn, testified.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Ques.</i> Had you any reason to apprehend that an assault would be
made on Mr. Sumner after the delivery of that speech?</p>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> I can only say that I had no reason to apprehend danger to
Mr. Sumner, except what I inferred from the language of Senators
at the time he closed his speech. What they said then led me to
believe that an attempt to assail him was intended, or was intended to
be encouraged.</p>

<p>“<i>Ques.</i> Were the threats of Senators, of which you speak, uttered
in debate or outside?</p>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> They were uttered in debate. I do not recollect hearing
anything of the kind except what was uttered in debate, coupled with
the manner of Senators. These are all the reasons I had for apprehending
an assault.</p>

<p>“<i>Ques.</i> (by Mr. Cobb). Did you communicate to Mr. Wilson your
apprehensions in reference to Mr. Sumner?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> I did, before the Senate adjourned, communicate with Mr.
Wilson. I said to Mr. Wilson that it was my opinion an assault was
intended upon Mr. Sumner, and that he had better see to it that no
assault was made.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">James W. Simonton, Esq.</span>, reporter of the <i>New York Times</i>,
being sworn, testified.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I was standing in the Senate Chamber near Mr. Clayton’s seat,
conversing with Mr. Morgan and Mr. Murray of the House, when
I heard a blow. I exclaimed, ‘What is that?’ and immediately
started. One step brought me in view of the parties. My attention
was directed at once to Mr. Sumner, with a view to notice his condition.
I saw that he was just in the act of springing forward. As
he came upon his feet, I noticed him spin around, and then stagger
backwards and sideways until he fell. Mr. Brooks was striking him
with his cane, which then seemed to be broken off one third its length.
I rushed up as rapidly as possible, with other gentlemen, and, as I
reached him, or near him, Mr. Keitt rushed in, running around Mr.
Sumner and Mr. Brooks with his cane raised, crying, ‘Let them alone!
let them alone!’ threatening myself and others who had rushed in to
interfere. Mr. Brooks continued to strike until he was seized by Mr.
Murray, and until Mr. Sumner, who had lodged partly against the
desk, had fallen to the floor. He did not fall directly, but, after lodging
for an instant upon, then slipped off from his desk, and fell upon
the floor. I do not know of anything further.</p>

<p>“<i>Ques.</i> How often did Mr. Brooks strike?</p>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> With great rapidity: at least a dozen, and I should think
twenty blows. Mr. Sumner, at the first moment when I looked at
him, seemed to me to be unconscious.</p>

<p>“<i>Ques.</i> (by Mr. Pennington). Do you know of any concert between
Mr. Brooks and any other person, a member of Congress, to
attack Mr. Sumner?</p>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> I do not know anything of my own knowledge. I noticed
several persons who were there. I saw Mr. Keitt there. I have a
distinct recollection of seeing several parties, perhaps not distinct
enough to mention them. I saw several Senators present immediately
afterwards, but whether they were there at the time of the occurrence
I could not say. My attention was directed especially to Mr. Sumner,
and to Mr. Keitt, who seemed to be acting in concert with Mr.
Brooks.</p>

<p>“<i>Ques.</i> State, if you can, what Mr. Keitt said or did from first to
last.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>

<p>“<i>Ans.</i> I saw him as I was approaching the parties. I noticed him
run in from the centre aisle, and raise his cane. He used the words I
have spoken; or rather, my impression is that the precise expression
was, ‘Let them alone, God damn you!’”</p>

</div>

<p>This is only a portion of the evidence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Committee, after taking evidence, made a report, signed
by Mr. Campbell, Mr. Spinner, and Mr. Pennington, which, after
setting forth the facts, concludes with the following resolutions.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That Preston S. Brooks be, and he is forthwith, expelled
from this House as a Representative from the State of South Carolina.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That this House hereby declare its disapprobation of the
said act of Henry A. Edmundson and Lawrence M. Keitt in regard to
the said assault.”</p>

</div>

<p>A minority report, signed by Mr. Cobb and Mr. Greenwood,
concluded with the following resolution.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That this House has no jurisdiction over the assault alleged
to have been committed by the Hon. Preston S. Brooks, a member of
this House from the State of South Carolina, upon the Hon. Charles
Sumner, a Senator from the State of Massachusetts, and therefore deem
it improper to express any opinion on the subject.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the House, the substitute moved by Mr. Cobb was lost,&mdash;yeas
66, nays 145. The resolution of expulsion was lost,&mdash;yeas
121, nays 95,&mdash;the two thirds required for expulsion not voting
in favor thereof. The other resolution, declaring disapprobation
of the act of Henry A. Edmundson and Lawrence M. Keitt, was
divided, and the censure of Keitt was voted,&mdash;yeas 106, nays 96;
that of Edmundson was lost,&mdash;yeas 60, nays 136. A long preamble,
setting forth the facts, was adopted,&mdash;yeas 104, nays 83.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the vote upon the resolution of expulsion,
Mr. Brooks, with some difficulty, obtained leave to address the
House. Mr. Giddings objected, but, at the request of friends,
withdrew his objection, contrary to his own judgment. In the
course of a speech vindicating his conduct, Mr. Brooks took
credit to himself for not beginning a revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sir, I cannot, <em>on my own account</em>, assume the responsibility, in the
face of the American people, of commencing a line of conduct which
in my heart of hearts I believe would result in subverting the foundations
of this Government and in drenching this Hall in blood. No
act of mine, and on my personal account, shall inaugurate revolution;
but when you, Mr. Speaker, return to your own home, and hear the
people of the great North&mdash;and they are a great people&mdash;speak of me
as a bad man, you will do me the justice to say that a blow struck by
me at this time would be followed by revolution,&mdash;and this I know.
[<em>Applause and hisses in the gallery.</em>]”</p>

</div>

<p>Afterwards he seemed to take credit for using the instrument
he did.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I went to work very deliberately, as I am charged,&mdash;and this is
admitted,&mdash;and speculated somewhat as to whether I should employ a
horsewhip or a cowhide; but, knowing that the Senator was my superior
in strength, it occurred to me that he might wrest it from my
hand, and then&mdash;for I never attempt anything I do not perform&mdash;<em>I
might have been compelled to do that which I would have regretted the
balance of my natural life</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>At these words, according to the papers of the day, there was
a voice from the House:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He would have killed him!”</p>

</div>

<p>The speech concluded:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And now, Mr. Speaker, I announce to you, and to this House, that
I am no longer a member of the Thirty-Fourth Congress.”</p>

</div>

<p>On which the <i>Globe</i> remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Brooks then walked out of the House of Representatives.”<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In fact, his resignation was already in the hands of the Governor
of South Carolina, to take effect on his announcing his
resignation to the House. In this way he avoided any other censure,
after the failure of the resolution of expulsion.</p>

<p>Returning to South Carolina, Mr. Brooks presented himself
again to his constituents, and was triumphantly reëlected. On
the 1st of August, 1856, his commission was presented to the
House, when, according to the <i>Globe</i>, he “came forward and the
Speaker administered to him the oath to suppor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>t the Constitution
of the United States.”</p>

<p>While proceedings were pending in the House, Mr. Brooks was
indicted by the Grand Jury of the District of Columbia. The
following letters of Mr. Sumner, written at Silver Spring, near
Washington, where he was the guest of F. P. Blair, Esq., show
his indisposition to take part in the proceedings.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Silver Spring</span>, June 30, 1856.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I find myself unable to attend Court to-day. Since
the summons of the Marshal, I have suffered a relapse, by which I am
enfeebled, and also admonished against exertion. Being out of town,
I have not had an opportunity of consulting my attending physician;
but a skilful medical friend, who has visited me here, earnestly insists
that I cannot attend Court for some time without peril to my health.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Silver Spring</span>, July 1, 1856.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have your letter of 30th June, in which you ask
my consent with regard to the course you shall take in the conduct of
a criminal proceeding now pending in the Circuit Court of the United
States for the District of Columbia. I am surprised at this communication.
In giving my testimony before the Grand Jury, I stated that
I appeared at the summons of the law, and that I wished it distinctly
understood that the proceeding was instituted without any suggestion
on my part, and that I had nothing to do, directly or indirectly, with
its conduct. Nothing has occurred to change my relation to the proceeding.
Its whole conduct belongs to the Attorney of the United
States.</p>

</div>

<p>When the trial came on, Mr. Sumner had left for Philadelphia.
Mr. Brooks was sentenced to pay a fine of three hundred dollars.</p>

<p>William Y. Leader, of Philadelphia, who testified before the
magistrate, drew up the following account of the assault, which
is now published for the first time.</p>

<p>“I arrived in Washington City on the morning of the 22d of May,
1856. It was my first visit to Washington. After attending to some
business, I visited the Capitol. It was about twelve o’clock, and both
Houses of Congress were in session. I went to the Hall of the House of
Representatives first. I remained until the House adjourned, which
was in a short time, as no business was transacted further than the passage
of some resolutions in relation to, and several addresses on, the
death of Hon. John G. Miller, of Missouri. I next went to the gallery
of the Senate Chamber. Hon. Mr. Geyer, of Missouri, was delivering
a eulogy on the death of Mr. Miller, after which a series of resolutions
on the same subject were passed, when the Senate adjourned. I then
went into the Senate Chamber, for the purpose of delivering a letter to
Hon. J. J. Crittenden, but, finding him engaged talking to the Hon. L.
S. Foster, of Connecticut, I walked up and down the Chamber, waiting
until he would be disengaged. While doing so, a gentleman mentioned
the name of Mr. Sumner. I had never seen Mr. Sumner, but, having
read several of his speeches, I was anxious to see him, and, looking in
the direction from which the voice came, I observed Dr. Madeira, of
Philadelphia, introducing to Mr. Sumner one of the then editors of the
Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, <em>Transcript</em>. Mr. Sumner then shook
the person by the hand and begged him to excuse him, as he was writing
on time, that he might get a number of documents, which he was
franking, ready for the mail, and told the gentleman he would be
pleased to see him at his residence at any time he might call. The
gentleman left him, and I walked to the seat of Senator Seward, which
was vacant, and which is next but one from Senator Sumner’s, in the
same row. Senator Sumner was writing at his seat. On his table was
a large pile of documents, and he was writing very rapidly, with his
head very close to the desk. While he was thus engaged, I observed
a gentleman come in the door and walk to the seat of Mr. Sumner.
He came up in a quiet, easy manner, and spoke, saying, ‘Mr. Sumner.’
Mr. Sumner did not rise, but merely turned up his head, as if to see
who was speaking to him, when the gentleman continued, saying,
‘I have read your speech twice, and have come to the conclusion that
it is an insult to my native State, and my gray-haired relative, Judge
Butler,’&mdash;and before he had finished the sentence, he struck Mr. Sumner
a blow on the top of his head, which was uncovered, which must
have stunned him. He struck him two or three times after, when
Mr. Sumner raised himself in his chair, not, as has been said, to defend
himself, but with his head bent down, as if trying to extricate himself
from his chair and desk. While in this position he received several
more blows, when he fell against his desk, which upset, and he fell to
the floor. While lying here, he was struck until the cane broke into
pieces. <em>Mr. Sumner uttered no word</em>, and no one attempted to interfere,
though a number of persons gathered around, crying, ‘Don’t interfere!‘
‘Go it, Brooks!’ ‘Give the damned Abolitionists hell!’ &amp;c.
Mr. Crittenden was the first man to seize the perpetrator of the outrage,
and take him off his victim. Several of his friends led him off, while
Mr. Sumner lay on the floor until Mr. Morgan and Mr. Simonton and
one or two others came in and took him into an adjoining room. I
was the only person who saw the whole of the transaction, and, being
so close to Mr. Sumner, I heard and saw all that was said and done. I
afterwards had Mr. Brooks arrested for the offence, and on the trial of
the case gave my testimony as I have here related it, and which is
substantially correct. I had never known Mr. Sumner, and, as we
belonged to different political parties, I had no prejudice in his favor.
From beginning to end it was one of the most cold-blooded, high-handed
outrages ever committed, and had Mr. Sumner not been a very
large and powerfully built man, it must have resulted in his death.
No ordinary man could possibly have withstood so many blows upon
his bare head.”</p>

</div>

<p>General James Watson Webb, afterwards Minister to Brazil,
and at the time editor of the New York <i>Courier and Enquirer</i>,
made the following report to his paper.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Those who witnessed the assault say, that, in receiving the blows,
given in quick succession and with terrible force, Mr. Sumner attempted
to rise from his seat, to which he was in a measure pinioned
by his legs being under the desk,&mdash;the legs of which, like all the
desks of the Senate Chamber, have plates of iron fastened to them,
and these plates are firmly secured to the floor. His first attempt to
rise was a failure, and he fell back into his chair, and the blows of his
assailant continued to fall mercilessly upon his uncovered head. His
second attempt ripped up the iron fastenings of his desk, and he precipitated
himself forward, but, being blinded and stunned, wide of the
direction in which Mr. Brooks stood. Prostrated on the floor, and
covered with blood as I never saw man covered before, the assault
continued, until Mr. Murray and Mr. Morgan, both members of the
House of Representatives from New York, had time to come from the
extreme southeast angle of the Senate Chamber, and who, forcing
their way through the crowd of Senators, and others, in the midst of
whom Mr. Sumner was lying senseless and being beaten, they seized
the assailant and rescued the body of Sumner.”</p>

</div>

<p>On the morning of January 28, 1857, the country was startled
by the telegraphic news that Mr. Brooks had died suddenly on the
evening before, in great pain, at his hotel in Washington. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
terms of this despatch belong to this note.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Hon. Preston S. Brooks died this evening at Brown’s Hotel.
He had been in bed for a day or two, suffering from the effects of a
severe cold. He was telling his friends that he had passed the crisis
of his illness, and felt considerably improved in health, when he was
seized with violent croup, and died in about ten minutes afterwards.
He expired in intense pain. The event, so sudden, has caused much
surprise and sympathy throughout the city.</p>

<p>“Dr. Boyle, who was called to dress the wounds of Mr. Sumner,
was his physician. Considerable excitement was produced by this visitation
of Providence. His personal friends seem smitten, while the
mass of those who crowd the hotels come to the general conclusion that
the wrath of man is avenged in the justice of God. There are numerous
knots of people in each of the hotels, talking about the death of
Brooks. He died a horrid death, and suffered intensely. He endeavored
to tear his own throat open to get breath.”</p>

</div>

<p>Later advices revealed that Mr. Keitt, with others, was by his
bedside. His death was announced to the House of Representatives,
January 29th, when his funeral took place in the House.</p>

<p>Senator Butler died at home, in South Carolina, May 25, 1857.
Mr. Keitt, after an active and vindictive part in the Rebellion,
died in battle in Virginia, in June, 1864.</p>

</div>

<h3>II.<br />
ADOPTION OF THE ASSAULT BY EMINENT SLAVE-MASTERS,
AND BY THE SOUTH GENERALLY.</h3>

<div class="medium">

<p>More significant even than the assault was the evidence, which
soon accumulated, showing its adoption at the South. Had it
been disapproved there, it would have stood as the act of an individual.
Had it been received even in silence, without formal disapprobation,
there would have been at least a question with regard
to the sentiment there, and charity would have supplied the
most extenuating interpretation. But the spirit of Slavery was
too strong, making haste to speak out by its representatives of
every degree. It began at once.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>
<p>On the publication of Mr. Sumner’s testimony, there were some
explanations in the Senate.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Hon. John Slidell, of Louisiana, described
himself as in conversation with several gentlemen, in the
anteroom of the Senate, when he first heard of the assault.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We had been there some minutes,&mdash;I think we were alone in
the antechamber,&mdash;when a person (if I recollect aright, it was Mr.
Jones, a messenger of the Senate) rushed in, apparently in great trepidation,
and said that somebody was beating Mr. Sumner. We heard
this remark without any particular emotion; for my own part, I confess
I felt none.”</p>

</div>

<p>He then describes meeting Mr. Sumner in the doorway of the
reception-room, “leaning on two persons whom I did not recognize.
His face was covered with blood.” He adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am not particularly fond of scenes of any sort. I have no
associations or relations of any kind with Mr. Sumner; I have not
spoken to him for two years.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Robert Toombs, of Georgia, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As for rendering Mr. Sumner any assistance, I did not do it.
As to what was said, some gentleman present condemned it in Mr.
Brooks. I stated to him, or to some of my own friends, probably, <em>that
I approved it. That is my opinion.</em>”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Benjamin P. Wade, of Ohio, followed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If the principle now announced here is to prevail, let us come
armed for the combat; and although you are four to one, I am here to
meet you. God knows a man can die in no better cause than in vindicating
the rights of debate on this floor; and I have only to ask,
that, if the principle is to be approved by the majority, and to become
part and parcel of the law of Congress, it may be distinctly understood.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Henry Wilson followed, saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner was stricken down on this floor by a brutal, murderous,
and cowardly assault.”</p>

</div>

<p>At this point he was interrupted by Hon. A. P. Butler, of South
Carolina, according to the unamended report of the newspapers,
by the exclamation from his seat,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You are a liar!”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span></p>

<p>In the <i>Globe</i> it is said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Butler, in his seat, impulsively uttered words which Senators
around advised him were not parliamentary, and he subsequently,
at the instance of Senators, requested that the words might be withdrawn.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Lafayette S. Foster, of Connecticut, followed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As I understood the honorable Senator from Georgia to remark
that he approved of striking forcibly down in this Chamber a member
of the Senate, I think it incumbent on me, recently a member
of this body, and not having participated in its debates, to say a
word.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Foster then proceeded to vindicate liberty of speech.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Shortly afterwards, in another speech, Senator Butler said of
Mr. Sumner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Though his friends have invested him with the dress of Achilles
and offered him his armor, he has shown that he is only able to fight
with the weapons of Thersites, <em>and deserved what that brawler received
from the hands of the gallant Ulysses</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The declaration of Mr. Wilson, that the attack upon Mr. Sumner
was “a brutal, murderous, and cowardly assault,” incensed the
friends of Mr. Brooks, and many threats of personal violence were
made. General Lane, of Oregon, afterward Democratic candidate
for Vice-President, called upon Mr. Wilson, and placed a challenge
from Mr. Brooks in his hands. Mr. Wilson promptly placed in
General Lane’s hands, contrary to the urgent advice of Mr. Giddings
and other friends, who thought his reply might bring on
a personal conflict, an answer to his hostile note, in which he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“I characterized, on the floor of the Senate, the assault upon my
colleague as ‘brutal, murderous, and cowardly.’ I thought so then:
I think so now: I have no qualification whatever to make in regard
to those words. I have never entertained, in the Senate or elsewhere,
the idea of personal responsibility, in the sense of the duellist. I have
always regarded duelling as the lingering relic of a barbarous civilization,
which the law of the country has branded as crime. While,
therefore, I religiously believe in the right of self-defence in its broadest
sense, the law of my country and the matured convictions of my
whole life alike forbid me to meet you for the purpose indicated in
your letter.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Hon. James M. Mason, a Senator from Virginia, already
odious as author of the Fugitive Slave Bill, and afterwards so conspicuous
in the Rebellion, thus declared his approbation of the
assault:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Selma, Frederick County, Va.</span>,<br />
29th September, 1856.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I have had the honor to receive your letter of the
13th instant, inviting me, on behalf of the constituents of Colonel Preston
S. Brooks, to a dinner to be given to him by them, on the 3d of
October next, in ‘testimony of their complete indorsement of his Congressional
course.’</p>

<p>“It has been my good fortune to have enjoyed the acquaintance
of your able and justly honored Representative, on terms both of
social and political intercourse, from his entrance into the House
of Representatives, and I know of none whose public career I hold
more worthy the full and cordial approbation of his constituents than
his.</p>

<p>“He has shown himself alike able and prompt to sustain the rights
and the interests of his constituents in debate and by vote, or to vindicate
in a different mode, and under circumstances of painful duty, the
honor of his friend. I would gladly, therefore, unite with you, were it
in my power, in the testimonial proposed by his generous constituents,
but regret that the distance which separates us, and my engagements
at home, must forbid it.</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<p>“But, in reverse of all this, should a dominant sectional vote be
directed to bring into power those pledged in advance to break down
the barriers interposed by the compact of federation for the security of
one section against the other, then, in my calmest judgment, but one
course remains for the South,&mdash;<em>immediate, absolute, and eternal separation</em>.</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<p>“Again regretting, Gentlemen, that I cannot be with you,</p>

<p class="sig2">“I am, with great respect,</p>

<p class="sig3">“<span class="smcap">J. M. Mason</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Hon. Jefferson Davis, Secretary of War, and afterwards
President of the Rebel States, thus declared his approbation:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, Monday, September 22, 1856.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I have the honor to acknowledge your polite and
very gratifying invitation to a public dinner, to be given by the people
of the Fourth Congressional District to their Representative, Hon. P.
S. Brooks.</p>

<p>“It would give me much pleasure, on any occasion, to meet you, fellow-citizens
of the Fourth District of South Carolina; and the gratification
would be materially heightened by the opportunity to witness
their approbation of a Representative <em>whom I hold in such high regard
and esteem</em>. Circumstances will not permit me, however, to be with
you, as invited, and I have only to express to you my sympathy with
the feeling which prompts the sons of Carolina to welcome the return
of a brother who has been the subject of vilification, misrepresentation,
and persecution, <em>because he resented a libellous assault upon the reputation
of their mother</em>.</p>

<p>“With many thanks to you and those whom you represent for your
kind remembrance of me,</p>

<p class="sig2">“I am very truly your friend and fellow-citizen,</p>

<p class="sig3">“<span class="smcap">Jefferson Davis</span>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Arthur Simpkins</span>, <span class="smcap">James Gillam</span>, and others.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here may properly be introduced the language of Mr. Savage,
of Tennessee, in the House of Representatives, in his eulogy of
Mr. Brooks.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To die nobly is life’s chief concern. History records but one
Thermopylæ: there ought to have been another, and that one for
Preston S. Brooks. Brutus stabbed Cæsar in the Capitol, and, whatever
we may now think of the wisdom and justice of the deed, the
world has ever since approved and applauded it. So shall the scene in
the Senate Chamber carry the name of the deceased to all future generations,
long to be remembered after all here are forgotten, and until
these proud walls crumble into ruins.”<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These uttered words were modified in the <em>Globe</em>.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In these adhesions it will not fail to be observed that Toombs,
Slidell, Mason, and Davis, afterwards chiefs in the Rebellion,
made themselves conspicuous by their positive and unequivocal
language.</p>

<p>Mr. Buchanan, the Democratic candidate for the Presidency,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>deserves to be added to this list. At the Commencement of
Franklin and Marshall College, in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, July
23, 1856, one of the students, W. W. Davis, of Sterling, Illinois,
made an address on “The Decline of Political Integrity,” where
he described modern politicians as “so truckling in their character
and destitute of moral courage and political integrity, that men
are found who applaud the attack of <em>Canine</em> Brooks upon the
noble Sumner for defending Freedom.” The scene that ensued,
and the remarks of Mr. Buchanan, who was present on the
stage, were given by a correspondent of the <em>New York Tribune</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“During the delivery of this sentence, the whole house was still as
death, and at its close it was heartily applauded. Mr. Davis finished
his oration and retired from the front of the stage amid thunders of
applause and showers of bouquets from his lady friends. For him it
was truly a triumph. But on retiring to his seat, next to that of Mr.
Buchanan, did he receive congratulation of the Sage of Wheatland?
No, no. Mr. Buchanan said to him, loud enough that the whole class
could hear: ‘<em>My young friend, you look upon the dark side of the picture.
Mr. Sumner’s speech was the most vulgar tirade of abuse ever delivered
in a deliberative body.</em>’ To which the young orator replied, that
he ‘hoped Mr. Buchanan did not approve of the attacks upon Mr.
Sumner by Brooks and others.’ To which Mr. Buchanan rejoined,
that ‘<em>Mr. Brooks was inconsiderate, but that Senator Butler was a very
mild man</em>.’ Mr. Davis expressed his regret at the moderation of Mr.
Buchanan’s views, and dropped the conversation. After the close of
the exercises, the friends of Mr. Davis related what I have written.
Mr. Davis himself said, he ‘did not think for a moment that he was
not in conversation with James Buchanan,’ but now learns that it was
the Representative of the Cincinnati Platform he was addressed by.”</p>

</div>

<p>With such words of approbation from eminent leaders of the
South, it was natural that other organs of opinion there should be
stronger in their language. The people by formal acts, and the
press by a succession of articles, signalized their adhesion.</p>

<p>The following extract from a letter of a young gentleman, said
to be of “high respectability,” at Charleston, South Carolina, was
communicated for publication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“I suppose you have heard of the lambasting Mr. Brooks gave Mr.
Sumner. Well, the Charlestonians have subscribed ten cents each and
bought a splendid cane, with the words ‘<em>Hit him again</em>’ engraved on
the head; and if Mr. Sumner troubles South Carolina or Mr. Brooks
again, he will get something <em>engraved on his head</em> which will be very
apt to make him a <em>grave</em> subject.”</p>

</div>

<p>At a meeting at Martin’s Depot, South Carolina, the following
resolution was adopted.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, If Northern fanatics will persist in meddling with our
private institutions, we deem it expedient that Southern members
should reply to them by the use of <em>gutta-percha</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>At a meeting in Clinton, South Carolina, the following resolutions
were adopted by acclamation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That we, as a portion of the constituents of the Hon.
Preston S. Brooks, do heartily agree with him in chastising, coolly and
deliberately, the vile and lawless Sumner, of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That, for the high respect and full appreciation of Colonel
Brooks’s conduct, we present him a cane from the soil of his own
Congressional district, with this inscription: ‘<em>Use knock-down arguments</em>’:
feeling that none other can be effectual on a perverted mind
and degenerate race.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Columbia <i>South Carolinian</i>, of May 28, spoke thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We learn that some of the gentlemen of Charleston have provided
a suitable present, in the shape of a cane, to be given to Mr. Brooks,
to show their appreciation of his late act of ‘hiding’ the Abolition
Senator Sumner. It is to bear the inscription, ‘<em>Hit him again</em>.’ Meetings
of approval and sanction will be held not only in Mr. Brooks’s
district, but throughout the State at large, and a general and hearty
response of approval will reëcho the words ‘<em>Well done</em>,’ from Washington
to the Rio Grande.”</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Richmond Enquirer</i>, of May 30, reports a response from
the University of Virginia.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Another Cane for Mr. Brooks.</span>&mdash;We understand that a very
large meeting of the students of the University of Virginia was held on
Tuesday evening, to take into consideration the recent attack of the
Hon. Preston S. Brooks on Charles Sumner, in the United States
Senate Chamber. Several very eloquent speeches were delivered, all of
which fully approved the course of Mr. Brooks, and the resolution was
passed to purchase for Mr. Brooks a splendid cane. The cane is to
have a heavy gold head, which will be suitably inscribed, and also bear
upon it a device of the human head, badly cracked and broken. The
chivalry of the South, it seems, has been thoroughly aroused.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span></p>
<p>The <i>Richmond Examiner</i>, of May 30, testifies thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The chastisement of Sumner, in spite of the blustering nonsense
of the regiments of Yankee Bob Acres, who have been talking about
‘avenging his wrongs,’ will be attended with good results. The precedent
of Brooks <i>vs.</i> Sumner will become a respected authority at Washington.
It will be a ‘leading case,’ as it clearly defines the distinction
between the liberty of speech as guarantied to the respectable American
Senator and that scandalous abuse of it by such men as Charles
Sumner.</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<p>“Far from blaming Mr. Brooks, we are disposed to regard him as a
conservative gentleman seeking to restore to the Senate that dignity
and respectability of which the Abolition Senators are fast stripping it.
His example should be followed by every Southern gentleman whose
feelings are outraged by unprincipled Abolitionists.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Richmond Enquirer</i> thus spoke, June 9th:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is idle to think of union or peace or truce with Sumner or Sumner’s
friends. Catiline was purity itself, compared to the Massachusetts
Senator, and his friends are no better than he. They are all (we mean
the leading and conspicuous ones) avowed and active traitors.&hellip;
Sumner and Sumner’s friends must be punished and silenced. Government
which cannot suppress such crimes as theirs has failed of its
purpose. Either such wretches must be hung or put in the penitentiary,
or the South should prepare at once to quit the Union. We would
not jeopard the religion and morality of the South to save a Union
that had failed for every useful purpose. Let us tell the North at once,
If you cannot suppress the treasonable action, and silence the foul,
licentious, and infidel propagandism of such men as Stephen Pearl
Andrews, Wendell Phillips, Beecher, Garrison, Sumner, and their
negro and female associates, let us part in peace.</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<p>“Your sympathy for Sumner has shaken our confidence in your
capacity for self-government more than all your past history, full of
evil portents as that has been. He had just avowed his complicity in
designs far more diabolical than those of Catiline or Cethegus,&mdash;nay,
transcending in iniquity all that the genius of a Milton has attributed
to his fallen angels. We are not surprised that he should be hailed as
hero and saint, for his proposed war on everything sacred and divine,
by that Pandemonium where the blasphemous Garrison, and Parker,
and Andrews, with their runaway negroes and masculine women, congregate.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>
<p>The <i>Richmond Enquirer</i> again spoke, June 12th:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the main, the press of the South applaud the conduct of Mr.
Brooks, without condition or limitation. Our approbation, at least, is
entire and unreserved. We consider the act good in conception, better
in execution, and best of all in consequence. The vulgar Abolitionists
in the Senate are getting above themselves. They have been
humored until they forget their position. They have grown saucy, and
dare to be impudent to gentlemen! Now, they are a low, mean, scurvy
set, with some little book-learning, but as utterly devoid of spirit or
honor as a pack of curs. Intrenched behind ‘privilege,’ they fancy
they can slander the South and insult its representatives with impunity.
The truth is, they have been suffered to run too long without
collars. They must be lashed into submission. Sumner, in particular,
ought to have nine-and-thirty early every morning. He is a great
strapping fellow, and could stand the cowhide beautifully. Brooks
frightened him, and at the first blow of the cane he bellowed like a
bull-calf. There is the blackguard Wilson, an ignorant Natick cobbler,
swaggering in excess of muscle, and absolutely dying for a
beating. Will not somebody take him in hand? Hale is another
huge, red-faced, sweating scoundrel, whom some gentleman should kick
and cuff until he abates something of his impudent talk. These men
are perpetually abusing the people and representatives of the South,
for tyrants, robbers, ruffians, adulterers, and what not. Shall we
stand it?</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<p>“Mr. Brooks has initiated this salutary discipline, and he deserves
applause for the bold, judicious manner in which he chastised the
scamp Sumner. It was a proper act, done at the proper time, and
in the proper place.”</p>

</div>

<p>In a Democratic procession at Washington, one of the party
banners had this inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">“SUMNER AND KANSAS: LET THEM BLEED.”</p>

<p>Texts like these might be multiplied; but here are more than
enough to exhibit the brutal spirit of Slavery, and the extent of its
sympathy with the assault. This head may be properly closed
by the words of the <i>Charleston Standard</i> on the death of Mr.
Brooks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“Within the last year his name has transcended the limits of tongues
and nations. What will be the verdict of posterity upon him will depend
upon the question of power between the North and South. If
the North shall triumph, if the South shall be gradually ground
under, if Slavery shall be smuggled out of sight, and decent people
shall be ashamed to own it, he will be condemned and execrated;
but if the South shall stand firm in her integrity, if Slavery shall
not fall before its antagonist, but shall stand, as it is capable of standing,
<em>the great central institution of the land for all other interests to
climb upon</em>, and shall give law to opinion, as it shall give regulation to
Liberty, then his memory will be loved and venerated; <em>he will be recognized
as one of the first who struck for the vindication of the South</em>; and
as, like those who seized the tea in Boston Harbor, he had no other warrant
of authority than that afforded <em>by his own brave heart</em>, he will
only the more certainly be placed among the heroes and patriots of his
country.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here is a plain and most interesting recognition of the assault
as belonging to the glories of Slavery, while the author is one of
its heroes.</p>


<h3>III.<br />

PREVIOUS PERSONALITIES AND AGGRESSIONS.</h3>

<p>There is a proper interest in knowing the personal provocation
under which Mr. Sumner spoke. Something of this will be seen
in the early onslaught upon him by the combined forces of Slavery,
to which he replied promptly.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The <i>Globe</i> shows constantly
the tone which was adopted by the representatives of Slavery
towards all who presumed in any way to question its rights.
Here Mr. Butler, of South Carolina, was always prominent; and
when the question of the admission of Kansas as a Free State
occurred, he was especially aroused.</p>

<p>His previous personalities and aggressions were set forth by
Hon. Henry Wilson, in a speech made in the Senate, June 13,
1856, in direct reply to him, after he had spent two days in criticising
Mr. Sumner and defending his assailant. On this occasion
Senator Butler was particularly indignant because Mr. Sumner
had personified Slavery as a “harlot,” saying, “What in the name
of justice and decency could have ever led that man to use such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
language?”<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> In the course of his speech the Senator described
his former patronage of Mr. Sumner, saying, “I did not hesitate
to keep up what my friends complained of, an intercourse with
him, <em>which was calculated to give him a currency far beyond what he
might have had, if I had not indulged in that species of intercourse</em>.
My friends here and everywhere know it.”<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Mr. Wilson’s reply is
important in this history.</p>


<h4>SPEECH OF HON. HENRY WILSON.</h4>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I feel constrained, by a sense of duty to my
State, by personal relations to my colleague and friend, to trespass for
a few moments upon the time and attention of the Senate.</p>

<p>“You have listened, Mr. President, the Senate has listened, these
thronged seats and these crowded galleries have listened, to the extraordinary
speech of the honorable Senator from South Carolina, which
has now run through two days. I must say, Sir, that I have listened
to that speech with painful and sad emotions. A Senator of a sovereign
State more than twenty days ago was stricken down senseless on the
floor for words spoken in debate. For more than three weeks he has
been confined to his room upon a bed of weakness and of pain. The
moral sentiment of the country has been outraged, grossly outraged,
by this wanton assault, in the person of a Senator, on the freedom of
debate. The intelligence of this transaction has flown over the land,
and is now flying abroad over the civilized world; and wherever Christianity
has a foothold, or civilization a resting-place, that act will meet
the stern condemnation of mankind.</p>

<p>“Intelligence comes to us, Mr. President, that a civil war is raging
beyond the Mississippi; intelligence also comes to us that upon the
shores of the Pacific Lynch Law is again organized; and the telegraph
brings us news of assaults and murders around the ballot-boxes of New
Orleans, growing out of differences of opinion and of interests. Can
we be surprised, Sir, that these scenes, which are disgracing the character
of our country and our age, are rife, when a venerable Senator&mdash;one
of the oldest members of the Senate, and chairman of its Judiciary
Committee&mdash;occupies four hours of the important time of the Senate
in vindication of and apology for an assault unparalleled in the history
of the country? If lawless violence here, in this Chamber, upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>the person of a Senator, can find vindication, if this outrage upon the
freedom of debate finds apology from a veteran Senator, why may not
violent counsels elsewhere go unrebuked?</p>

<p>“The Senator from South Carolina commenced his discursive speech
by an allusion to the present condition of my colleague which I cannot
say exhibited good taste. I know it, personally, to be grossly unjust,
because I know that for more than twenty days&mdash;three weeks&mdash;Mr.
Sumner has been compelled to lie upon a bed of pain, from the
effects of blows received by him here in the Senate Chamber.</p>

<p>“The Senator from South Carolina, I am aware, referred to the evidence
of a medical person, who was accidentally employed in the early
stages of the case, but who has not seen Mr. Sumner lately. I have in
my hands the testimony of his present medical adviser, a distinguished
physician of this city, who has been selected for his known talents and
character, and who <em>understands</em> his present condition. The Secretary
will please to read his letter, which I now send to the desk.”</p>

<p>The Secretary read as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">C Street</span>, June 12, 1856.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;In answer to your inquiries, I have to state that I have been
in attendance on the Hon. Charles Sumner, as his physician, on account of
the injuries received by him in the Senate Chamber, from the 29th of May
to the present time,&mdash;part of this time in consultation with Dr. Perry, of
Boston, and Dr. Miller, of Washington.</p>

<p>“I have visited him at least once every day. During all this time Mr.
Sumner has been confined to his room, and the greater part of the day confined
to his bed.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Neither at the present moment</span>, <em>nor at any time since Mr. Sumner’s
case came under my charge</em>, <span class="smcap">has he been in a condition to resume his
duties in the Senate</span>.</p>

<p>“My present advice to him is to go into the country, where he can enjoy
fresh air; and I think it will not be prudent for him to enter upon his public
duties for some time to come.</p>

<p class="sig2">“Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="sig3">“<span class="smcap">H. Lindsly</span>.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hon. Henry Wilson.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson.</span> “Mr. President, this is the testimony of Dr. Lindsly,
known by the members of the Senate, and others around me, to be an
eminent physician of Washington. I will say, that Mr. Sumner, and
Mr. Sumner’s friends, when he was first assailed, underestimated altogether
the force of the assault. He is a man of great physical power,
in full vigor and maturity, and in the glow of health. For a day or
two after that assault he believed, and his friends believed, that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>he
would soon throw off its effects; but time disclosed the extent and
force of his injuries, while he was doomed to hours of restless, sleepless
pain. Dr. Perry, of Boston, a gentleman of great professional eminence,
accidentally in Washington, expressed the strongest solicitude
concerning his case. To his skill and advice I believe my colleague
and his friends are under the deepest obligations. His testimony before
the Committee is the testimony of one who knows what he affirms.&mdash;But
I pass from this topic.</p>

<p>“The Senator from South Carolina, through this debate, has taken
occasion to apply to Mr. Sumner, to his speech, to all that concerns
him, all the epithets&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Mr. Butler.</span> I used criticism, but not epithets.]</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>. “Well, Sir, I accept the Senator’s word, and I say
‘criticism.’ But I say, in his criticism, he used every word that I
can conceive a fertile imagination could invent, or a malignant passion
suggest. He has taken his full revenge here on the floor of the Senate,
here in debate, for the remarks made by my colleague. I do not take
any exception to this mode. This is the way in which the speech of
my colleague should have been met,&mdash;not by blows, not by an assault.</p>

<p>“The Senator tells us that this is not, in his opinion, an assault upon
the constitutional rights of a member of the Senate. He tells us that
a member cannot be permitted to print and send abroad over the world,
with impunity, his opinions,&mdash;but that he is liable to have them questioned
in a judicial tribunal. Well, Sir, if this be so,&mdash;he is a lawyer,
I am not,&mdash;I accept his view, and I ask, Why not have tested Mr.
Sumner’s speech in a judicial tribunal, and let that tribunal have settled
the question whether Mr. Sumner uttered a libel or not? Why
was it necessary, why did the ‘chivalry’ of South Carolina require,
that for words uttered on this floor, under the solemn guaranties of
Constitutional Law, a Senator should be met here by violence? Why
appeal from the floor of the Senate, from a judicial tribunal, to the
bludgeon? I put the question to the Senator,&mdash;to the ‘chivalry’ of
South Carolina,&mdash;ay, to ‘the gallant set’ (to use the Senator’s own
words) of ‘Ninety-Six,’&mdash;Why was it necessary to substitute the bludgeon
for the judicial tribunal?</p>

<p>“Sir, the Senator from South Carolina&mdash;and in what I say to him
to-day I have no disposition to say anything unkind or unjust, and if
I utter any such word, I will withdraw it at once&mdash;told us, that, when
my colleague came here, he came holding fanatical ideas, but that he
met him, offered him his hand, and treated him with courtesy, suppos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>ing,
as in other cases which had happened under his eye, that acquaintance
with Southern gentlemen might cure him of his fanaticism.
He gravely told us that his courtesy and attentions introduced Mr.
Sumner where he could not otherwise have gone. The Senator will
allow me to say that this is not the first time during this session we
have heard this kind of talk about ‘social influence,’ and the necessity
of association with gentlemen from the South, in order to have
intercourse with the refined and cultivated society of Washington.
Sir, Mr. Sumner was reared in a section of country where men know
how to be gentlemen. He was trained in the society of gentlemen, in
as good society as could be found in <em>that</em> section of the country. He
went abroad. In England and on the Continent he was received everywhere,
as he had a right to be received, into the best social circles,
into literary associations, and into that refined and polished society
which adorns and graces the present age in Western Europe. I do not
know where any gentleman could desire to go that Mr. Sumner could
not go, without the assistance of the Senator from South Carolina, or
any other person on this floor. Sir, we have heard quite enough of
this. It is a piny-wood doctrine, a plantation idea. Gentlemen reared
in refined and cultivated society are not accustomed to this language,
and never indulge in its use towards others.</p>

<p>“The Senator from South Carolina commenced his speech by proclaiming
what he intended to do, and he closed it by asserting what he
had done. Well, Sir, I listened to his speech with some degree of attention,
and I must say that the accomplishment did not come quite
up to what was promised, and that without his assurance the Senate
and the country would never have supposed that his achievements
amounted to what he assured us they did in this debate.</p>

<p>“The Senator complained of Mr. Sumner for quoting the Constitution
of South Carolina; and he asserted over and over again, and he
winds up his speech by the declaration, that the quotation made is not
in the Constitution. After making that declaration, he read the Constitution,
and read the identical quotation. Mr. Sumner asserted what is
in the Constitution; but there is an addition to it which he did not
quote. The Senator might have complained because he did not quote
it; but the portion not quoted carries out only the letter and the spirit
of the portion quoted. To be a member of the House of Representatives
of South Carolina, it is necessary to own a certain number of
acres of land and ten slaves, or seven hundred and fifty dollars of real
estate, free of debt. The Senator declared with great emphasis&mdash;and
I saw nods, Democratic nods, all around the Senate&mdash;that ‘a man
who was not worth that amount of money was not fit to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span> a Representative.’
That may be good Democratic doctrine,&mdash;it comes from
a Democratic Senator of the Democratic State of South Carolina, and
received Democratic nods and Democratic smiles,&mdash;but it is not in
harmony with the Democratic ideas of the American people.</p>

<p>“The charge made by Mr. Sumner was, that South Carolina was nominally
republican, but in reality had aristocratic features in her Constitution.
Well, Sir, is not this charge true? To be a member of the
House of Representatives of South Carolina, the candidate must own
ten men,&mdash;yes, Sir, ten men,&mdash;five hundred acres of land, or have seven
hundred and fifty dollars of real estate, free of debt; and to be a member
of the Senate double is required. This Legislature, having these
personal qualifications, placing them in the rank of a privileged few,
are elected upon a representative basis as unequal as the rotten-borough
system of England in its most rotten days. That is not all. This
Legislature elects the Governor of South Carolina and the Presidential
Electors. The people have the privilege of voting for men with these
qualifications, upon this basis, and they select their Governor for them,
and choose the Presidential Electors for them. The privileged few govern;
the many have the privilege of being governed by them.</p>

<p>“Sir, I have no disposition to assail South Carolina. God knows
that I would peril my life in defence of any State of this Union, if assailed
by a foreign foe. I have voted, and I will continue to vote, while
I have a seat on this floor, as cheerfully for appropriations, or for anything
that can benefit South Carolina, or any other State of this Union,
as for my own Commonwealth of Massachusetts. South Carolina is a
part of my country. Slaveholders are not the tenth part of her population.
There is somebody else there besides slaveholders. I am opposed
to its system of Slavery, to its aristocratic inequalities, and I
shall continue to be opposed to them; but it is a sovereign State of
this Union, a part of my country, and I have no disposition to do
injustice to it.</p>

<p>“The Senator assails Mr. Sumner for referring to the effects of Slavery
upon South Carolina in the Revolutionary era. What Mr. Sumner
said in regard to the imbecility of South Carolina, produced by Slavery,
in the Revolution, is true, and more than true,&mdash;yes, Sir, true,
and more than true. I can demonstrate its truth by the words and
correspondence of General Greene, by the words and correspondence of
Governor Matthews, General Barnwell, General Marion, Judge Johnson,
Dr. Ramsay, the historian, Mr. Gadsden, Mr. Burk, Mr. Huger,
and her Representatives, who came to Congress and asked the nation
to relieve her from her portion of the common burdens, because it was
necessary for her men to stay at home to keep her negro slaves in sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>jection.
These sons of South Carolina have given to the world the indisputable
evidence that Slavery impaired the power of that State in
the War of Independence.</p>

<p>“The Senator told us that South Carolina, which furnished one fifteenth
as many men as Massachusetts in the Revolution, ‘shed
hogsheads of blood where Massachusetts shed gallons.’ That is one
of the extravagances of the Senator,&mdash;one of his loose expressions,
absurd and ridiculous to others,&mdash;one of that class of expressions
which justify Mr. Sumner in saying that ‘he cannot ope his mouth,
but out there flies a blunder.’ This is one of those characteristics of
the Senator which naturally arrested the attention of a speaker like
Mr. Sumner, accustomed to think accurately, to speak accurately, to
write accurately, and to be accurate in all his statements. I say that
such expressions as those in which the Senator from South Carolina
has indulged in reference to this matter are of the class in which he
too often indulges, and which brought from my colleague that remark
at which he takes so much offence.&mdash;But enough of this.</p>

<p>“Sir, the Senator from South Carolina has undertaken to assure
the Senate and the country to-day that he is not the aggressor. Here
and now I tell him that Mr. Sumner was not the aggressor,&mdash;that the
Senator from South Carolina was the aggressor. I will prove this declaration
to be true beyond all question. Mr. Sumner is not a man who
desires to be aggressive towards any one. He came into the Senate
‘a representative man.’ His opinions were known to the country. He
came here knowing that there were but few in this body who could
sympathize with him. He was reserved and cautious. For eight
months here he made no speeches upon any question that could excite
the animadversion even of the sensitive Senator from South Carolina.
He made a brief speech in favor of the system of granting lands for
constructing railways in the new States, which the people of those
States justly applauded; and I will undertake to say that he stated
the whole question briefly, fully, and powerfully. He also made a
brief speech welcoming Kossuth to the United States. But, beyond
the presentation of a petition, he took no steps to press his earnest
convictions upon the Senate; nor did he say anything which could by
possibility disturb the most excitable Senator.</p>

<p>“On the 28th day of July, 1852, after being in this body eight
months, Mr. Sumner introduced a proposition to repeal the Fugitive
Slave Act. Mr. Sumner and his constituents believed that act to be
not only a violation of the Constitution of the United States, and a violation
of all the safeguards of the Common Law which have been garnered
up for centuries to protect the rights of the people, but at war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
with Christianity, humanity, and human nature,&mdash;an enactment that
is bringing upon this Republic the indignant scorn of the Christian and
civilized world. With these convictions, he proposed to repeal that
act, as he had a right to propose. He had made no speech. He rose
and asked the Senate to give him the privilege of making a speech.
‘Strike, but hear,’ said he, using a quotation. I do not know that he
gave the authority for it. Perhaps the Senator from South Carolina will
criticise it as a plagiarism, as he has criticised another application of a
classical passage. Mr. Sumner asked the privilege of addressing the
Senate. The Senator from South Carolina, who now tells us that he
had been his friend, an old and veteran Senator here, instead of feeling
that Mr. Sumner was a member standing almost alone, with only
the Senator from New York [Mr. <span class="smcap">Seward</span>], the Senator from New
Hampshire [Mr. <span class="smcap">Hale</span>], and Governor Chase, of Ohio, in sympathy
with him, objected to his being heard. He asked Mr. Sumner, tauntingly,
if he wished to make an ‘oratorical display’? and talked about
‘playing the orator’ and ‘the part of a parliamentary rhetorician.’
These words, in their scope and in their character, were calculated to
wound the sensibilities of a new member, and perhaps bring upon him
what is often brought on a member who maintains here the great doctrines
of Liberty and Christianity,&mdash;the sneer and the laugh under
which men sometimes shrink.</p>

<p>“Thus was Mr. Sumner, <em>before he had ever uttered a word on the subject
of Slavery here</em>, arraigned by the Senator from South Carolina, not for
what he ever had said, but for what he intended to say; and the Senator
announced that he must oppose his speaking, because he would
attack South Carolina. Mr. Sumner quietly said that he had no such
purpose; but the Senator did not wish to allow him to ‘make the
Senate the vehicle of communication for his speech throughout the
United States, to wash deeper and deeper the channel through which
flow the angry waters of agitation.’</p>

<p>“Now I charge here on the floor of the Senate, and before the country,
that the Senator from South Carolina was the aggressor,&mdash;that he
arraigned, in language which no man can defend, my colleague, before
he ever uttered a word on this subject on the floor of the Senate, and
in the face of his express disclaimer that he had no purpose of alluding
to South Carolina. This was the beginning; other instances follow.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sumner made, in February, 1854, a speech on the Kansas-Nebraska
Bill; and I want to call the attention of the Senate to the
manner in which he opened that speech. No man will pretend, that,
up to that day, he had ever uttered a word here to which any, the most
captious, could take objection. He commenced this magnificent speech,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
which any man within sound of my voice would have been proud to
have uttered, by saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘I would not forget those amenities which belong to this place, and are
so well calculated to temper the antagonism of debate; nor can I cease to
remember, and to feel, that, amidst all diversities of opinion, we are the
representatives of thirty-one sister republics, knit together by indissoluble
ties, and constituting that Plural Unit which we all embrace by the endearing
name of country.’</p>

</div>

<p>“Thus, on that occasion, by those words of kindness, did he commence
his speech; and he continued it to the end in that spirit. The
effort then made might be open to opposition by argument; but there
is no word there to wound the sensibilities of any Senator, or to justify
any personal bitterness. And yet this speech, so cautious and guarded,
and absolutely without any allusion to the Senator from South Carolina
or his State, brought down upon him the denunciations and assaults
of the Senator, who now complains that his own example has
been in some measure followed. I intend to hold that Senator to-day
to the record. Yes, Sir, I have his words, and I intend to hold him
responsible for them. I am accustomed to deal with facts, as that
Senator will discover before I close.</p>

<p>“A few days after this speech was delivered, the Senator from South
Carolina addressed the Senate,&mdash;then, as now, in a long speech, running
through two days. You will find his speech in the <i>Congressional Globe</i>,
Appendix, Vol. XXIX. pp. 232-240. Sir, you must read that speech,
read it all through, look at it carefully, consider its words and its
phrases, to understand the tone he evinced towards Mr. Sumner, and
towards Massachusetts, and the Northern men who stood with him. I
need not say that there were bitter words, taunting words, in the
speech. I was not here to listen to it; but we all know&mdash;and I say
it without meaning to give offence&mdash;that the Senator from South
Carolina is often more offensive in the manner which he exhibits, and
he throws more of contempt and more of ridicule in that manner than
he can put in his words,&mdash;and he is not entirely destitute of the
ability of using words in that connection.</p>

<p>“On page 232 we have the insinuation that Mr. Sumner is a ‘plunging
agitator,’&mdash;that is the phrase, ‘plunging agitator.’ That is a
plunging expression. I think it is one of those loose expressions that
brought down on the Senator the censure of my colleague the other
day. Then we have another insinuation,&mdash;that he is a ‘rhetorical
advocate’; and then these words: ‘He has not, in my judgment,
spoken with the wisdom, the judg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>ment, and the responsibilities of a
statesman.’ Now, Sir, I doubt the propriety of applying to members
of this body such phrases as these, ‘plunging agitator,’ ‘rhetorical
advocate,’ and then to say he has not shown ‘the wisdom, the judgment,
and the responsibilities of a statesman.’</p>

<p>“On page 234 he says of Mr. Sumner: ‘It seems to me, that, if he
wished to write poetry, he would get a negro to sit for him.’ That is
his expression, and the report says it was followed by ‘laughter,’&mdash;whether
laughter at Mr. Sumner, or at the refined wit of the Senator
from South Carolina, I cannot say, not having been present.</p>

<p>“On page 236 he again alludes to a remark by Mr. Sumner, saying
(to quote his own words), ‘which I think even <em>common prudence or
common delicacy</em> would have suggested to him that he ought not to have
made.’</p>

<p>“On the same page, again alluding to Mr. Sumner, he says: ‘Our
Revolutionary fathers thought nothing of these <em>sickly distinctions</em>
which gentlemen use now to make the South odious.’</p>

<p>“Again, on the same page, alluding to other remarks of Mr. Sumner,
he says: ‘They may furnish materials for what I understand is a very
popular novel,&mdash;<em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>. I have no doubt they may do
this; but I put it to the gentleman, <em>are his remarks true?</em>’ ‘Are his
remarks true?’ was the question, full of insolence and of accusation,
put to Mr. Sumner in the face of the Senate.</p>

<p>And again he says: ‘They dealt some hard licks, <em>but they are not
true as historical facts</em>.’</p>

<p>“So you will perceive Mr. Sumner was not the first man to raise this
question of truth and veracity on the floor of the Senate.</p>

<p>“On the same page the Senator from South Carolina made a misstatement
of a fact, which was promptly corrected by Mr. Sumner, and
by General Shields, then a member of the Senate.</p>

<p>“On page 237 there are insinuations made of ‘pseudo-philanthropy,’
and also insinuations of ‘<em>mere</em> eloquence,&mdash;professions of philanthropy,&mdash;a
philanthropy of adoption more than affection.’ Yes, Sir, according
to the Senator from South Carolina, the Senator from Massachusetts,
and those who think with him, have ‘adopted’ their philanthropy;
it is not the ‘philanthropy of affection, but of adoption,’&mdash;‘a philanthropy
that professes much and does nothing, with a long advertisement
and short performance.’ These are expressive words, and the
Senator from South Carolina should remember that these words, uttered
with the peculiar forms which he affects, are anything but calculated
to be complimentary to my colleague or any other Senator.</p>

<p>“On the same page, allusions, which, from the context, are in the
nature of insinuations, are made against Mr. Sumner and his assoc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>iates,
as to ‘those who stand aloof and hold up an ideal standard
of morality, emblazoned by imagination and sustained in ignorance, or
<em>perhaps more often planted by criminal ambition and heartless hypocrisy</em>.’
‘Criminal ambition and heartless hypocrisy’ are the terms
used by the Senator from South Carolina, in application to Senators
on this floor, and to a large portion of the country, which concurs
with them!</p>

<p>“On page 239 he tauntingly speaks of a ‘machine,’ in reference
to the people who hold Mr. Sumner’s opinions, ‘oiled by Northern
fanaticism.’ I do not know what kind of a machine that is,&mdash;a machine
‘oiled by Northern fanaticism.’ The Senator who uses these
phrases towards members of this body, and towards a section of the
Union, is a Senator who tries to make us believe that he is a man who
comprehends the whole country and all its interests, and who has nothing
in him of the spirit of a sectional agitator! He takes great offence
because my colleague holds him up as one of the chieftains of
sectional agitation. I think my colleague is right,&mdash;that the Senator
from South Carolina <em>is</em> one of the chieftains of a <em>sectionalism</em> at war
with the fundamental ideas that underlie our democratic institutions,
and at war with the repose and harmony of the country.</p>

<p>“On page 234 he again talks about ‘sickly sentimentality,’ and
he charges that this ‘sickly sentimentality’ now governs the councils
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Yes, Sir, the Senator from
South Carolina makes five distinct assaults upon Massachusetts.
Massachusetts councils governed by sickly sentimentality! Sir, Massachusetts
stands to-day where she stood when the little squad assembled,
on the 19th of April, 1775, to fire the first gun of the Revolution.
The sentiments that brought those humble men to the little green at
Lexington, and to the bridge at Concord, which carried them up the
slope of Bunker Hill, and which drove forth the British troops from
Boston, never again to press the soil of Massachusetts,&mdash;that sentiment
still governs the councils of Massachusetts, and rules in the hearts of
her people. The feeling which governed the men of that glorious
epoch of our history is the feeling of the men of Massachusetts of to-day.</p>

<p>“Those sentiments of liberty and patriotism have penetrated the
hearts of the whole population of that Commonwealth. Sir, in that
State, every man, no matter what blood runs in his veins, or what may
be the color of his skin, stands up before the law the peer of the proudest
that treads her soil. This is the sentiment of the people of Massachusetts.
In equality before the law they find their strength. They
know this to be right, if Christianity is true,&mdash;and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span> will maintain
it in the future, as they have in the past; and the civilized world, the
coming generations, those who are hereafter to give law to the universe,
will pronounce that in this contest Massachusetts is right, inflexibly
right, and South Carolina, and the Senator from South Carolina,
wrong. The latter are maintaining the odious relics of a barbarous
age and civilization,&mdash;not the civilization of the New Testament,&mdash;not
the civilization that is now blessing and adorning the best portions
of the world.</p>

<p>“On page 234 he says: ‘At the time of the passage of the law in
Massachusetts abolishing Slavery, pretty near all the grown negroes
disappeared somewhere; and, as the historian expresses it, the little
negroes were left there, without father or mother, and with hardly a
God,&mdash;were sent about as puppies, to be taken by those who would
feed them.’</p>

<p>“Now, Sir, the Constitution of Massachusetts was framed and went
into operation in 1780. The Supreme Court decided, that, by the provisions
of that Constitution, slaves could not be held as bondmen in
the Commonwealth. Slavery was abolished by judicial decision,&mdash;abolished
at once, without limitation, without time to send men out
of the State. It may be that some mean Yankee in Massachusetts&mdash;and
God never made a meaner man than a mean Yankee [<em>laughter</em>]&mdash;may
have hurried his slave out of that Commonwealth, and sold him
into bondage. But Massachusetts, by one stroke of the pen of the
Supreme Court, abolished Slavery forever in that State, and the slaves
became freemen. They and their descendants are there to-day, as
intelligent as the average people of the United States, many of them
being men that grace and adorn the State, which, by just and equal
laws, protects them in the enjoyment of all their rights,&mdash;men whom
I am proud here to call my constituents, and some of whom I recognize
as my friends.</p>

<p>“On page 236 he introduced statistics into his speech, in regard to
pauperism, insanity, and drunkenness, in disparagement of Massachusetts.
This introduction called up Mr. Everett to respond for his
State; and if gentlemen are anxious to know what he said, they have
but to turn to the debates of that day, and read the words of a man
always to be comprehended, whatever his opinions may be.</p>

<p>“On page 240 it will be found that the Senator from South Carolina
asserts that Massachusetts has been an ‘anti-nigger State.’ This is
the classic phrase of the Senator from South Carolina. He said that
Massachusetts was an ‘anti-nigger State,’ and that, ‘when she had
to deal with these classes of persons practically, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>her philanthropy
became very much attenuated.’ Attenuated philanthropy! These
are the words of the Senator who never makes assaults, who is never
the aggressor! They were in reply to a speech which made no personal
assault upon the Senator or upon his State. These remarks were made
in regard to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>“And again, still anxious to make his lunge at Massachusetts, on
page 240 he repeats the accusation that Massachusetts ‘treated her
little slaves as puppies.’</p>

<p>“To all these <em>personal</em> allusions of the Senator Mr. Sumner made no
reply. He did reply for his State, and replied fully, as the occasion
required, and in a manner contrasting by its moderation and its
decency with that of the Senator from South Carolina. I have references
to other passages in that speech by the Senator from South
Carolina, but I shall not weary the Senate by quoting them. They
are of the same nature and character. In this same speech, however,
not content with assailing Mr. Sumner, he went on to attack the honorable
Senator from New York [Mr. <span class="smcap">Seward</span>], and he compared him
to ‘the condor, that soars in the frozen regions of ethereal purity, yet
lives on garbage and putrefaction.’ This is the language of an honorable
Senator, who prides himself upon his elegant diction, and whose
friends plume themselves upon the exceeding care with which he turns
his phrases in debate.</p>

<p>“For some time I have been giving elegant extracts from a single
speech of the Senator from South Carolina. I come here to another.
On the 14th of March, 1854, he assailed the three thousand clergymen
of New England who had sent their remonstrance here against the
passage of the Nebraska Bill. He declared ‘they deserved the grave
censure of the Senate.’ Sir, I have great respect for the Senate of the
United States, and I have respect for these three thousand clergymen.
I suppose they care more for their own opinions, and the approbation
of their own consciences, than even for the grave censure of this
Senate.</p>

<p>“He then went on to make use of one of those loose expressions for
which Mr. Sumner censured him the other day so severely. He employed
this language: ‘I venture to say that they [the clergymen]
never saw the memorial they sent’: thus directly charging the religious
teachers of our country with palming on the Senate a spurious
document.</p>

<p>“To this attack of the Senator from South Carolina, and others, on
the clergy of New England, a portion of Mr. Sumner’s reply may be
given, as an illustration of the parliamentary character and perfect temper
of his discourse.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘There are men in this Senate justly eminent for eloquence, learning,
and ability, but there is no man here competent, except in his own conceit,
to sit in judgment on the clergy of New England. Honorable Senators
who have been so swift with criticism and sarcasm might profit by their
example. <em>Perhaps the Senator from South Carolina</em> [Mr. <span class="smcap">Butler</span>], <em>who is not
insensible to scholarship, might learn from them something of its graces</em>. Perhaps
the Senator from Virginia [Mr. <span class="smcap">Mason</span>], who finds no sanction under
the Constitution for any remonstrance from clergymen, might learn from
them something of the privileges of an American citizen. Perhaps the
Senator from Illinois [Mr. <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>], who precipitated this odious measure
upon the country, might learn from them something of political wisdom.’</p>

</div>

<p>“But this history of personalities is not complete. One of the greatest
outbreaks is yet to come.</p>

<p>“On the 22d June, 1854, my predecessor, Mr. Rockwell, presented
a memorial, signed by three thousand citizens of Boston, asking for
the immediate repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act. That memorial was
severely attacked, and Mr. Sumner rose to vindicate it. He was followed
by the Senator from South Carolina, who made a succession of
assaults and insinuations.</p>

<p>“Among other things, he characterized Mr. Sumner’s speech as
‘a species of rhetoric which is intended to feed the fires of <em>fanaticism</em>
which he has helped to kindle in his own State,&mdash;a species of rhetoric
which is not becoming the gravity of this body.’</p>

<p>“And again, on the same page, the Senator says: ‘When gentlemen
rise and <em>flagrantly misrepresent</em> history, as that gentleman has
done, by a Fourth-of-July oration, by vapid rhetoric, by a species of
rhetoric which, I am sorry to say, ought not to come from a scholar,
a rhetoric with more fine color than real strength, I become impatient
under it.’</p>

<p>“Here, it will be observed, is a direct charge that Mr. Sumner had
<em>flagrantly misrepresented</em> history, that his speech was ‘vapid rhetoric’
and ‘a Fourth-of-July oration.’ The Senator displays great sensibility
because Mr. Sumner charges him, in guarded phrase, with a
‘deviation from truth, with so much of passion as to save him from the
suspicion of intentional aberration.’ And yet, with unblushing assurance,
he openly charges Mr. Sumner with <em>flagrant misrepresentation</em>,
without any of that apology of passion which Mr. Sumner conceded to
him. Nor is this the first or the last time in which the Senator did
this.</p>

<p>“Again, on the same page, he insinuates that Mr. Sumner was
‘a rhetorician playing a part.’ This is a favorite idea of the polite
Senator. And yet again, on page 1517, first column, he breaks forth
in insinuations against Mr. Sumner, as follows: ‘I do not want any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
of these flaming speeches here, calculated to excite merely, to feed a
flame without seeing where it shall extend. No, Sir: do not let us
involve the country in a contest to be decided by mobs infuriated by
<em>the flaming speeches of servile orators</em>.’</p>

<p>“Then follows a passage which can be appreciated only by giving it
at length.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘I have said I am perfectly willing, so far as I am concerned, to let the
memorial be referred; but I wish to ask the honorable Senator from Massachusetts
who presented it [Mr. <span class="smcap">Rockwell</span>] a question, and I believe, from
the impression which he made on me to-day, that he will answer it. If we
repeal the Fugitive Slave Law, will the honorable Senator tell me that
Massachusetts will execute the provision of the Constitution without any
law of Congress? Suppose we should take away all laws, and devolve upon
the different States the duties that properly belong to them, I would ask
that Senator, whether, under the prevalence of public opinion there, Massachusetts
would execute that provision as one of the constitutional members
of this Union? Would they send fugitives back to us, after trial by jury, or
any other mode? Will this honorable Senator [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sumner</span>] tell me that
he will do it?</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Does the honorable Senator ask me if I would personally
join in sending a fellow-man into bondage? “Is thy servant a dog,
that he should do this thing?”</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Mr. Butler.</span> <em>These are the prettiest speeches that I ever heard.</em>
[<i>Laughter.</i>] He has them turned down in a book by him, I believe, and he
has them so elegantly fixed that I cannot reply to them. [<i>Laughter.</i>] <em>They
are too delicate for my use.</em> [<i>Renewed laughter.</i>] <em>They are beautiful things</em>,
made in a factory of rhetoric, somewhat <em>of a peculiar shape</em>, but, I must be
permitted to say, not of a definite texture. Now what does he mean by
talking about his not being a dog? [<i>Continued laughter.</i>] What has that
to do with the Constitution, or the constitutional obligations of a State?
[<i>Laughter.</i>] <em>Well, Sir, it was a beautiful sentiment, no doubt, as he thought,
and perhaps he imagined he expressed it with Demosthenian abruptness and
eloquence.</em> [<i>Laughter.</i>] I asked him whether he would execute the Constitution
of the United States, without any Fugitive Slave Law, and he answered
me, is he a dog&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator asked me if I would help to reduce a fellow-man
to bondage. I answered him.</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Mr. Butler.</span> Then you would not obey the Constitution. Sir [<i>turning
to Mr.</i> <span class="smcap">Sumner</span>], standing here before this tribunal, where you swore to
support it, <em>you rise and tell me that you regard it the office of a dog to enforce
it. You stand in my presence, as a coëqual Senator, and tell me that it is a dog’s
office to execute the Constitution of the United States?</em></p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Mr. Pratt.</span> Which he has sworn to support.</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I recognize no such obligation.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Mr. Butler.</span> I know you do not. <em>But nobody cares about your recognitions
as an individual; but as a Senator, and a constitutional representative,
you stand differently related to this body.</em> But enough of this.’</p>

</div>

<p>“This attack upon Mr. Sumner is without a parallel in the records of
the Senate. But the Senator from South Carolina was not alone in this
outrage. He was assisted, I regret to say, by other Senators,&mdash;particularly
by the Senator from Virginia [Mr. <span class="smcap">Mason</span>], by the then
Senator from Indiana [Mr. <span class="smcap">Pettit</span>]; but I do not quote their words,
for I am now dealing with the Senator from South Carolina.</p>

<p>“To all these Mr. Sumner replied fully and triumphantly, in a speech
which, though justly severe throughout, was perfectly parliamentary,
and which was referred to at that time, and has been often mentioned
since, as a specimen of the greatest severity, united with perfect taste
and propriety.</p>

<p>“The above imputation which had been heaped upon him, with regard
to the Constitution, was completely encountered, and his position
vindicated by the authority of Andrew Jackson, and the still earlier
authority of Thomas Jefferson. On this point no attempt has ever
been made to answer him.</p>

<p>“In the course of this speech, alluding to the Senator from South
Carolina, Mr. Sumner used words which I now adopt, not only for
myself on this occasion, but also as an illustration of his course in this
controversy.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘It is he, then, who is the offender. For myself, Sir, I understand the
sensibilities of Senators from “slaveholding communities,” and would not
wound them by a superfluous word. Of Slavery I speak strongly, as I
must; but thus far, even at the expense of my argument, I have avoided
the contrasts, founded on details of figures and facts, which are so obvious,
between the Free States and “slaveholding communities”; especially have
I shunned all allusion to South Carolina. But the venerable Senator, to
whose discretion that State has entrusted its interests here, will not allow me
to be still. God forbid that I should do injustice to South Carolina!’</p>

</div>

<p>“But the Senator from South Carolina was not to be silenced or
appeased. He still returned to those personalities which flow so
naturally and unconsciously from his lips. The early, bitter, personal
assaults were repeated. He charged Mr. Sumner’s speech with being
‘unfair in statement.’ This is one of the delicate accusations of the
Senator. The next is bolder. He charged Mr. Sumner as ‘guilty of
historical perversion.’ Pray, with what face, after this, can he complain
of my colleague? But he seems determined still to press this
imputation in the most offensive form, for he next charges my colleague
with ‘<em>historical falsehood</em>, which the gentleman has committed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
in the fallacy of his <em>sectional</em> vision.’ It would be difficult to accumulate
into one phrase more offensive suggestions; and yet the Senator
now complains that he has had administered to him what he has so
often employed himself.</p>

<p>“All these are understood to have been accompanied by a manner
more offensive than the words.</p>

<p>“In these extracts you will see something of the Senator’s insolence,
in contrast with the quiet manner of Mr. Sumner, who, while defending
his position, was perfectly parliamentary.</p>

<p>“Other passages from the speech of the Senator might be quoted;
but the patience of the Senate is wellnigh exhausted by this long
exhibition of personalities; therefore I will content myself with only
one more. Here it is.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘I know, Sir, he said the other day that all he said was the effusion of
an impulsive heart. But it was the effusion of his drawer. Talk to me
about the effusions of the heart! What kind of effusions are those which
escape from tables, from papers played like cards sorted for the purpose?
They are weapons prepared by contribution, and discharged in this
body with a view of gratifying the feelings of resentment and malice,&mdash;with
a view of wounding the pride of the State which I represent, and
through her to stab the reputation of the other Southern States. <em>But, Sir,
we are above the dangers of open combat, and cannot be hurt by the assaults
even of attempted assassination.</em>’</p>

</div>

<p>“‘We cannot be hurt by attempted assassination,’ exclaims the
Senator from South Carolina!</p>

<p>“‘Attempted assassination’?</p>

<p>“It ill becomes the Senator from South Carolina to use these words in
connection with Massachusetts or the North. The arms of Massachusetts
are Freedom, Justice, Truth. Strong in these, she is not driven
to the necessity of resorting to ‘attempted assassination,’ either in or
out of the Senate.</p>

<p>“But the whole story is not yet told. I wish to refer to another
assault made by the Senator, which I witnessed myself a few days
after I took a seat in this body. On the 23d of February, 1855, on
one of the last days of the last session, to the bill introduced by the
Senator from Connecticut [Mr. <span class="smcap">Toucey</span>] Mr. Sumner moved an
amendment providing for the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act. He
made some remarks in support of that proposition. The Senator from
South Carolina followed him, saying, ‘I would ask him one question,
which he, perhaps, will not answer <em>honestly</em>.’ Mr. Sumner
said, ‘I will answer any question.’ The Senator went on to ask
questions, and received his answers; and then he said, speakin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>g of
Mr. Sumner, ‘I know he is not a tactician, and I shall not take
advantage of the infirmity of a man who does not know half his time
exactly what he is about.’ This is indeed extraordinary language for
the Senator from South Carolina to apply to the Senator from Massachusetts.
I witnessed that scene. I then deemed the language insulting:
the manner was more so. I hold in my hands the remarks of
the <i>Louisville Journal</i>, a Southern press, upon this scene. I shall not
read them to the Senate, for I do not wish to present anything which
the Senator may even deem offensive. I will say, however, that his
language and his deportment to my colleague on that occasion were
aggressive and overbearing in the extreme. And this is the Senator
who never makes assaults! But not content with assaulting Mr.
Sumner, he winds up his speech by a taunt at ‘Boston philanthropy.’
Surely, no person ever scattered assault more freely.</p>

<p>“I have almost done. But something has occurred this session which
illustrates the Senator’s manner. Not content with making his own
speeches, he interrupted the Senator from Missouri [Mr. <span class="smcap">Geyer</span>], and
desired him to insert in his speech an assault on Massachusetts. Here
are his words.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘I wish my friend would incorporate into his speech an old law of Massachusetts
which I have found. I would remind my friend of an old league
between the four New England States, made while they were colonies, expressly
repudiating trial by jury for the reclamation of fugitive slaves.
They called them “slaves,” too, or rather “fugitive servants”; and they
say they shall be delivered up on the certificate of one magistrate.’</p>

</div>

<p>“Here is another instance of the Senator’s looseness of assertion,
even on law, upon the knowledge of which he has plumed himself in this
debate. Sir, there were no slaves in Massachusetts at that day. The
law alluded to was passed in 1643. It was not until 1646, three years
afterward, that the first slaves were imported into Massachusetts from
the coast of Africa, and these very slaves were sent back to their native
land at public expense. The following is a verbatim copy of the
remarkable statute by which these Africans were returned to Guinea,
at the expense of the Commonwealth.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘The General Court, conceiving themselves bound by the first opportunity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>to bear witness against the heinous and crying sin of man-stealing,
as also to prescribe <em>such timely redress for what is past, and such a law for the
future, at may sufficiently deter all others belonging to us to have to do in such
vile and most odious courses, justly abhorred of all good and just men</em>, do order
that the negro interpreter, with others unlawfully taken, be, by the first
opportunity, at the charge of the country for present, sent to his native
country of Guinea, and a letter with him, of the indignation of the Court
thereabouts, and justice hereof.’</p>

</div>

<p>“In the face of this Act of 1646, the learned Senator from South
Carolina wished his friend from Missouri to incorporate into his speech
a false accusation against Massachusetts and the New England colonies.
And he went so far as to assert that this old law contained an allusion
to ‘slaves,’ when the word ‘slaves’ was not mentioned, and ‘servants’
only was employed.</p>

<p>“Sir, I might here refer to the assault made by the Senator from
South Carolina on the Senator from Iowa [Mr. <span class="smcap">Harlan</span>], in which he
taunted that Senator with being a clergyman, and modestly told him,
in the face of the country, that ‘he understood Latin as well as that
Senator understood English.’</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Mr. Butler.</span> I never taunted any gentleman with being a clergyman;
and the Senator from Iowa will not say so. I said that I had
respect for his vocation; but when he attempted to correct my speech,
I put him right.]</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson.</span> “Whether it was a taunt or not, the Senator disclaims
its being so, and I accept the disclaimer; but I apprehend it was not
intended as a compliment to the Senator from Iowa, or that it was received
as such by that Senator, particularly when taken in connection
with the other taunting assumption of the Senator from South Carolina,
that he ‘understood Latin as well as that Senator understood
English.’</p>

<p>“Thus has Mr. Sumner been by the Senator from South Carolina systematically
assailed in this body, from the 28th of July, 1852, up to
the present time,&mdash;a period of nearly four years. He has applied to
my colleague every expression calculated to wound the sensibilities of
an honorable man, and to draw down upon him sneers, obloquy, and
hatred, in and out of the Senate. In my place here, I now pronounce
these continued assaults upon my colleague unparalleled in the history
of the Senate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“I come now to speak for one moment of the late speech of my colleague,
which is the alleged cause of the recent assault upon him, and
which the Senator from South Carolina has condemned so abundantly.
That speech&mdash;a thorough and fearless exposition of what Mr. Sumner
entitled ‘The Crime against Kansas’&mdash;from beginning to end is
marked by entire plainness. Things are called by their right names.
The usurpation in Kansas is exposed, and also the apologies for it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span> successively.
No words were spared which seemed necessary to the exhibition.
In arraigning the <em>Crime</em>, it was natural to speak of those
who sustained it. Accordingly, the Administration is constantly held
up to condemnation. Various Senators who have vindicated this
Crime are at once answered and condemned. Among these are the
Senator from South Carolina, the Senator from Illinois [Mr. <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>],
the Senator from Virginia [Mr. <span class="smcap">Mason</span>], and the Senator from Missouri
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Geyer</span>]. The Senator from South Carolina now complains of Mr.
Sumner’s speech. Surely, it is difficult to see on what ground that
Senator can make any such complaint. The speech was, indeed, severe,&mdash;severe
as truth,&mdash;but in all respects parliamentary. It is true that
it handles the Senator from South Carolina freely; but that Senator
had spoken repeatedly in the course of the Kansas debate, once at
length and elaborately, and at other times more briefly, and foisting
himself into the speeches of other Senators, and identifying himself
completely with the Crime which my colleague felt it his duty to
arraign. It was natural, therefore, that his course in the debate, and
his position, should be particularly considered. And in this work Mr.
Sumner had no reason to hold back, when he thought of the constant
and systematic and ruthless attacks which, utterly without cause, he
had received from that Senator. The only objection which the Senator
from South Carolina can reasonably make to Mr. Sumner is, that
he struck a strong blow.</p>

<p>“The Senator complains that the speech was printed before it was
delivered. Here, again, is his accustomed inaccuracy. It is true that
it was in the printer’s hands, and was mainly in type; but it received
additions and revisions after its delivery, and was not put to press till
then. Away with this petty objection! The Senator says that twenty
thousand copies have gone to England. Here, again, is his accustomed
inaccuracy. If they have gone, it is without Mr. Sumner’s agency.
But the Senator foresees the truth. Sir, that speech will go to England;
it will go to the Continent of Europe; it has gone over the country,
and has been read by the American people as no speech ever delivered
in this body was read before. That speech will go down to coming
ages. Whatever men may say of its sentiments,&mdash;and coming ages
will indorse its sentiments,&mdash;it will be placed among the ablest parliamentary
efforts of our own age or of any age.</p>

<p>“The Senator from South Carolina tells us that the speech is to
be condemned, and he quotes the venerable and distinguished Senator
from Michigan [Mr. <span class="smcap">Cass</span>]. I do not know what Mr. Sumner could
stand. The Senator says he could not stand the censure of the Senator
from Michigan. <em>I could</em>; and I believe there are a great many i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>n this
country whose powers of endurance are as great as my own. I have
great respect for that venerable Senator; but the opinions of no Senator
here are potential in the country. This is a Senate of equals. The
judgment of the country is to be made up on the records formed here.
The opinions of the Senator from Michigan, and of other Senators here,
are to go into the record, and will receive the verdict of the people.
By that I am willing to stand.</p>

<p>“The Senator from South Carolina tells us that the speech is to be
condemned. It has gone out to the country. It has been printed by
the million. It has been scattered broadcast amongst seventeen millions
of Northern freemen who can read and write. The Senator condemns
it; South Carolina condemns it: but South Carolina is only a
part of this Confederacy, and but a part of the Christian and civilized
world. South Carolina makes rice and cotton, but South Carolina
contributes little to make up the judgment of the Christian and civilized
world. I value her rice and cotton more than I do her opinions
on questions of scholarship and eloquence, of patriotism or of liberty.</p>

<p>“Mr. President, I have no desire to assail the Senator from South
Carolina, or any other Senator in this body; but I wish to say now
that we have had quite enough of this asserted superiority, social and
political. We were told, some time ago, by the Senator from Alabama
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Clay</span>], that those of us who entertained certain sentiments fawned
upon him and other Southern men, if they permitted us to associate
with them. This is strange language to be used in this body. I never
fawned upon that Senator. I never sought his acquaintance,&mdash;and I
do not know that I should feel myself honored, if I had it. I treat him
as an equal here,&mdash;I wish always to treat him respectfully; but when
he tells me or my friends that we fawn upon him or his associates, I
say to him that I have never sought, and never shall seek, any other
acquaintance than what official intercourse requires with a man who
declared, on the floor of the Senate, that he would do what Henry Clay
once said ‘no gentleman could do,’&mdash;hunt a fugitive slave.</p>

<p>“The Senator from Virginia, not now in his seat [Mr. <span class="smcap">Mason</span>], when
Mr. Sumner closed his speech, saw fit to tell the Senate that his hands
would be soiled by contact with ours. The Senator is not here: I wish
he were. I have simply to say that I know nothing in that Senator,
moral, intellectual, or physical, which entitles him to use such language
towards members of the Senate, or any portion of God’s creation. I
know nothing in the State from which he comes, rich as it is in the
history of the past, that entitles him to speak in such a manner. I am
not here to assail Virginia. God knows I have not a feeling in my
heart against her, or against her public men; but I do say it is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>time
that these arrogant assumptions ceased here. This is no place for
assumed social superiority, as though certain Senators held the keys of
cultivated and refined society. Sir, they do not hold the keys, and
they shall not hold over me the plantation whip.</p>

<p>“I wish always to speak kindly towards every man in this body.
Since I came here, I have never asked an introduction to a Southern
member of the Senate,&mdash;not because I have any feelings against them,
for God knows I have not; but I knew that they believed I held opinions
hostile to their interests, and I supposed they would not desire
my society. I have never wished to obtrude myself on their society,
so that certain Senators could do with me, as they have boasted they
did with others,&mdash;refuse to receive their advances, or refuse to recognize
them on the floor of the Senate. Sir, there is not a Coolie in the
Guano Islands of Peru who does not think the Celestial Empire the
whole Universe. There are a great many men who have swung the
whip over the plantation, who think they not only rule the plantation,
but make up the judgment of the world, and hold the keys not only to
political power, as they have done in this country, but to social life.</p>

<p>“The Senator from South Carolina assails the resolutions of my
State, with his accustomed looseness, as springing from ignorance, passion,
prejudice, excitement. Sir, the testimony before the House Committee
sustains all that is contained in those resolutions. Massachusetts
has spoken her opinions; and although the Senator has quoted
the <i>Boston Courier</i> to-day,&mdash;and I would not rob him of any consolation
he can derive from that source,&mdash;I know Massachusetts, and I
can tell him, that, of the twelve hundred thousand people of Massachusetts,
you cannot find in the State one thousand, Administration office-holders
included, who do not look with loathing and execration upon
the outrage on the person of their Senator and the honor of their State.
The sentiment of Massachusetts, of New England, of the North, approaches
unanimity. Massachusetts has spoken her opinions. The
Senator is welcome to assail them, if he chooses; but they are on the
record. They are made up by the verdict of her people, and they understand
the question, and from their verdict there is no appeal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. President, I have spoken freely; I shall continue always to
speak freely. I seek no controversy with any man; but I shall express
my sentiments frankly, and the more frankly because on this
floor my colleague has been smitten down for words spoken in debate,
and because there are those who, unmindful of the Constitution of their
country, claim the right thus to question us.”</p>

<p>Under this head must be put the speech of Hon. Anson Burlingame,
afterwards so justly distinguished as the Minister of
China, made in the House of Representatives, June 21, 1856.
Here is an extract.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But, Mr. Chairman, all these assaults upon the State of Massachusetts
sink into insignificance, compared with the one I am about
to mention. On the 19th of May it was announced that Mr. Sumner
would address the Senate upon the Kansas question. The floor of the
Senate, the galleries, and avenues leading thereto were thronged with
an expectant audience; and many of us left our places in this House
to hear the Massachusetts orator. To say that we were delighted with
the speech we heard would but faintly express the deep emotions of our
hearts awakened by it. I need not speak of the classic purity of its
language, nor of the nobility of its sentiments. It was heard by many;
it has been read by millions. There has been no such speech made in
the Senate since the days when those Titans of American eloquence,
the Websters and the Haynes, contended with each other for mastery.</p>

<p>“It was severe, because it was launched against tyranny. It was
severe as Chatham was severe, when he defended the feeble colonies
against the giant oppression of the mother country. It was made in
the face of a hostile Senate. It continued through the greater portion
of two days; and yet, during that time, the speaker was not once called
to order. This fact is conclusive as to the personal and parliamentary
decorum of the speech. He had provocation enough. His State had
been called ‘hypocritical.’ He himself had been called ‘a puppy,’
‘a fool,’ ‘a fanatic,’ and ‘a dishonest man.’ Yet he was parliamentary
from the beginning to the end of his speech. No man knew
better than he did the proprieties of the place, for he had always observed
them. No man knew better than he did parliamentary law,
because he had made it the study of his life. No man saw more
clearly than he did the flaming sword of the Constitution turning every
way, guarding all the avenues of the Senate. But he was not thinking
of these things; he was not thinking then of the privileges of the Senate,
nor of the guaranties of the Constitution. He was there to denounce
tyranny and crime; and he did it. He was there to speak for
the rights of an empire; and he did it bravely and grandly.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>

<p>“So much for the occasion of the speech. A word, and I shall be
pardoned, about the speaker himself. He is my friend; for many and
many a year I have looked to him for guidance and light, and I never
looked in vain. He never had a personal enemy in his life; his character
is as pure as the snow that falls on his native hills; his heart
overflows with kindness for every being having the upright form of
man; he is a ripe scholar, a chivalric gentleman, and a warm-hearted,
true friend. He sat at the feet of Channing, and drank in the sentiments
of that noble soul. He bathed in the learning and undying love
of the great jurist, Story; and the hand of Jackson, with its honors
and its offices, sought him early in life, but he shrank from them with
instinctive modesty. Sir, he is the pride of Massachusetts. His mother
Commonwealth found him adorning the highest walks of literature and
law, and she bade him go and grace somewhat the rough character of
political life. The people of Massachusetts&mdash;the old, and the young,
and the middle-aged&mdash;now pay their full homage to the beauty of his
public and private character. Such is Charles Sumner.</p>

<p>“On the 22d day of May, when the Senate and the House had
clothed themselves in mourning for a brother fallen in the battle of life
in the distant State of Missouri, the Senator from Massachusetts sat in
the silence of the Senate Chamber, engaged in the employments appertaining
to his office, when a member from this House, who had taken
an oath to sustain the Constitution, stole into the Senate, that place
which had hitherto been held sacred against violence, and smote him
as Cain smote his brother.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Mr. Keitt</span> (in his seat). That is false.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Burlingame.</span> I will not bandy epithets with the gentleman.
I am responsible for my own language. Doubtless he is responsible
for his.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Keitt.</span> I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Burlingame.</span> I shall stand by mine.]</p>

</div>

<p>“One blow was enough; but it did not satiate the wrath of that
spirit which had pursued him through two days. Again and again,
quicker and faster, fell the leaden blows, until he was torn away from
his victim, when the Senator from Massachusetts fell in the arms of his
friends, and his blood ran down on the Senate floor. Sir, the act was
brief, and my comments on it shall be brief also. I denounce it in the
name of the Constitution it violated. I denounce it in the name of the
sovereignty of Massachusetts, which was stricken down by the blow.
I denounce it in the name of civilization, which it outraged. I denounce
it in the name of humanity. I denounce it in the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
that fair play which bullies and prize-fighters respect. What! strike
a man when he is pinioned,&mdash;when he cannot respond to a blow?
Call you that chivalry? In what code of honor did you get your
authority for that? I do not believe that member has a friend so dear
who must not, in his heart of hearts, condemn the act. Even the
member himself, if he has left a spark of that chivalry and gallantry
attributed to him, must loathe and scorn the act. God knows, I do
not wish to speak unkindly or in a spirit of revenge; but I owe it to
my manhood, and the noble State I in part represent, to express my
deep abhorrence of the act.</p>

<p>“But, much as I reprobate the act, much more do I reprobate the
conduct of those who were by and saw the outrage perpetrated. Sir,
especially do I notice the conduct of that Senator, recently from the
free platform of Massachusetts, with the odor of her hospitality on
him, who stood there, not only silent and quiet, while it was going on,
but, when it was over, approved the act. And worse,&mdash;when he had
time to cool, when he had slept on it, he went into the Senate Chamber
of the United States, and shocked the sensibilities of the world by
approving it. Another Senator did not take part because he feared his
motives might be questioned, exhibiting as extraordinary a delicacy as
that individual who refused to rescue a drowning mortal because he
had not been introduced to him. [<em>Laughter.</em>] Another was not on
good terms; and yet, if rumor be true, that Senator has declared that
himself and family are more indebted to Mr. Sumner than to any other
man; yet, when he saw him borne bleeding by, he turned and went
on the other side. O magnanimous Slidell! O prudent Douglas! O
audacious Toombs!”</p>

</div>

<p>This speech drew from Mr. Brooks a challenge, which was
promptly accepted by Mr. Burlingame, who insisted upon these
terms: “Weapons, rifles; distance, twenty paces; place, District
of Columbia; time of meeting, the next morning.” Hon. L. D.
Campbell, who acted as Mr. Burlingame’s friend, substituted the
Clifton House, Canada, for the District of Columbia. The friends
of Mr. Brooks, assuming that the excitement growing out of the
assault made it dangerous for him to traverse the country, prevented
the meeting from taking place.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following resolves were adopted by the Legislature of
Massachusetts, and duly presented to both Houses of Congress.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<i>Resolves concerning the recent Assault upon the Honorable Charles
Sumner at Washington.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, By the Senate and House of Representatives of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, that we have received with deep concern
information of the recent violent assault committed in the Senate
Chamber at Washington upon the person of the Honorable Charles
Sumner, one of our Senators in Congress, by Preston S. Brooks, a
member of the House of Representatives from South Carolina,&mdash;an
assault which no provocation could justify, brutal and cowardly in
itself, a gross breach of parliamentary privilege, a ruthless attack upon
the liberty of speech, an outrage of the decencies of civilized life, and
an indignity to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Legislature of Massachusetts, in the name of
her free and enlightened people, demands for her representatives in the
National Legislature entire <em>Freedom of Speech</em>, and will uphold them in
the proper exercise of that essential right of American citizens.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That we approve of Mr. Sumner’s manliness and courage
in his earnest and fearless declaration of free principles and his defence
of human rights and free territory.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Legislature of Massachusetts is imperatively
called upon by the plainest dictates of duty, from a decent regard to
the rights of her citizens, and respect for her character as a sovereign
State, to demand, and the Legislature of Massachusetts hereby does
demand, of the National Congress, a prompt and strict investigation
into the recent assault upon Senator Sumner, and the expulsion by the
House of Representatives of Mr. Brooks of South Carolina, and any
other member concerned with him in said assault.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That his Excellency the Governor be requested to transmit
a copy of the foregoing resolves to the President of the Senate and
Speaker of the House of Representatives, and to each of the Senators
and Members of the House of Representatives from this Commonwealth,
in the Congress of the United States.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Governor of New York addressed Mr. Sumner directly by
letter as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">State of New York, Executive Department.<br />
Albany</span>, May 28, 1856.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Honorable Charles Sumner</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;From the moment the lightning flashed the intelligence
of the barbarous and brutal assault made upon you by the
sneaking, slave-driving scoundrel Brooks, the blood has tingled in my
veins, and I have desired to express to you, not my abhorrence of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>villain, for I could not find words adequate, but my personal sympathy
for you, and, in their behalf, that of the people of this State
(except a few ‘doughfaces,‘&mdash;we have still a very few, the breed is
not yet quite extinct here),&mdash;assuring you that the hearts of our people
are warmly and strongly with you, and that your noble and eloquent
speech has already been very generally read by our citizens,&mdash;that
it is not only entirely approved, but highly applauded,&mdash;and
that its doctrines, sentiments, and expressions, and its author, will be
<em>sustained</em> and <span class="smcap">DEFENDED</span> by the people of this State.</p>

<p>“Ardently hoping for your recovery and speedy restoration to health,
I have the honor to remain, with the highest regard,</p>

<p class="sig2">“Your friend and servant,</p>

<p class="sig3">“<span class="smcap">Myron H. Clark.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>Of the resolutions at public meetings a few only are presented.</p>

<p>The following, from the pen of William Lloyd Garrison, were
adopted by the New England Antislavery Society.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“1. <i>Resolved</i>, That this Convention fully participates in the general
feeling of indignation and horror which is felt in view of the recent
dastardly and murderous assault made in the Senate Chamber at Washington
upon the person of the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts,
Hon. Charles Sumner, by a fitting Representative of and
from the lawless State of South Carolina; that, whether regard be had
to the place or to the manner in which it was committed, or to the
position and character of the victim, an assault characterized by greater
cowardice and ruffianism, or more daring in its contempt for all that
is sacred in constitutional liberty, or more comprehensively malignant
against the cause of human freedom, cannot be found on the page of history;
that it indicates a conspiracy, on the part of the Slave Oligarchy,
to ‘crush out’ freedom of speech on the floor of Congress as effectually as
it is done on the slave plantation, by putting in peril the life of every
Northern Senator or Representative who shall dare to lift up a manly
voice against Executive usurpation and border-ruffianism; and, therefore,
that whoever shall attempt to find any justification, or to frame
any apology for it, will reveal himself to be on a level with the base
assailant of as pure and generous and noble a man as ever yet occupied
a seat in our national legislature.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>

<p>“2. <i>Resolved</i>, That the speech made by Mr. Sumner, which has
subjected him to this most brutal treatment, is a speech at any time
worth dying for,&mdash;perfect in its conception, arrangement, and execution,
conclusive in its argument and evidence, masterly in its exposure
of Executive usurpation, sublime in its moral heroism, invincible in its
truthfulness, just in its personal impeachment, unsurpassed in its eloquence,
and glorious in its object; that, sealed with his blood, it shall
quicken the pulses of millions now living to engage in a death-grapple
with the Slave Power, and go down to posterity as a rich legacy to the
cause of Universal Liberty.”</p>

</div>

<p>The following resolution was passed unanimously, at the meeting
of Ministers in Boston, immediately after the news of the assault.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the murderous assault upon our honored Senator,
Charles Sumner, is not only a dastardly assault upon his person, and,
through him, upon the right of free speech, but also a wound which we
individually feel, and by which our very hearts bleed; and whether he
shall recover, or sink into a martyr’s grave,&mdash;which may God avert!&mdash;we
will address ourselves unto prayer and effort that this sorrowful
event may become the glorious resurrection of national virtue, and the
triumph of Freedom.”</p>

</div>

<p>At the Political Radical Abolition Convention, held at Syracuse,
N. Y., May 28th and 29th, 1856, on motion of Lewis Tappan,
the following was unanimously adopted.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That we hold in grateful admiration the character of
the Hon. Charles Sumner; that we honor the splendid services he has
rendered to the cause of Liberty; that we deeply sympathize with him
in his present sufferings in consequence of the cowardly and brutal attack
of the villain who dared to assault the intrepid advocate of the
Slave in the American Senate Chamber; and that we hope and pray
that Mr. Sumner’s valuable life will be spared until he shall witness
the complete overthrow of the execrable system that now brutalizes our
brethren in bondage, and brutalizes their oppressors, and disgraces our
country.”</p>

</div>

<p>At New York there was a meeting immense in numbers and
unprecedented in character, of which George Griswold was Chairman.
Among the speakers were William C. Bryant, Daniel Lord,
the eminent lawyer, Samuel B. Ruggles, Charles King, President
of Columbia College, Edwin B. Morgan, John A. Stevens, Joseph
Hoxie, and Henry Ward Beecher. The following resolutions
were moved by Hon. William M. Evarts, afterwards Attorney-General.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Whereas</i> it has become certainly known to the citizens of New
York, upon a formal investigation by a Committee of the Senate of the
United States, and otherwise, that on the 22d day of May, instant, the
Honorable Charles Sumner [<em>long, loud, and enthusiastic cheers</em>], Senator
from Massachusetts, while in his seat in the Senate Chamber, was
violently assaulted with a weapon of attack by Preston S. Brooks
[<em>loud hisses and groans for Brooks</em>], a member of the House of Representatives
from South Carolina, and beaten to insensibility upon the floor
of the Senate, which was stained with his blood; that the assailant
sought the Senate Chamber to perpetrate this outrage, provided with
his weapon and attended by a follower in its aid, and, taking his unarmed
victim unawares and in a posture which renders defence impossible,
by a heavy blow utterly disabled him, and with cruel repetition
inflicted frequent and bloody wounds upon his prostrate, helpless
form, with which wounds Senator Sumner now languishes in peril of
his life; that the sole reason alleged for this violent outrage was a
speech made by Senator Sumner in debate upon a public question then
pending in the Senate, no word of which was, during its delivery,
made the subject of objection by the President of the Senate or any
Senator, and which was concluded on the 20th day of May, instant:
Now, at a public meeting of citizens of New York, convened without
distinction of party [<em>applause</em>], and solely in reference to the public
event above recited, it is</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That we sincerely and respectfully tender our sympathy
to Senator Sumner in the personal outrage inflicted upon him,
and the anguish and peril which he has suffered and still suffers from
that outrage, and that we feel and proclaim that his grievance and his
wounds are not of private concern [<em>cheers</em>], but were received in the
public service, and every blow which fell upon his head we recognize
and resent as an insult and injury to our honor and dignity as a
people, and a vital attack upon the Constitution of the Union. [<em>Loud
cheers and applause.</em>]</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That we discover no trace or trait, either in the meditation,
the preparation, or the execution of this outrage by Preston S.
Brooks [<em>loud hisses and groans for Brooks</em>], which should qualify the
condemnation with which we now pronounce it <em>brutal, murderous, and
cowardly</em>. [<em>Continued cheers, and cries of ‘Read it again!’ Mr. Evarts
repeated the last clause. Voices,&mdash;‘Yes, cowardly! that’s the word!&mdash;cowardly!’
Another voice,&mdash;‘Now let him send another challenge!’</em>]</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That we have witnessed with unmixed astonishment
and the deepest regret the clear, bold, exulting espousal of the outrage,
and justification and honor of its perpetrator, exhibited by Senators
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>and Representatives of the Slave States, without distinction of party,
in their public places, and by the public press, without distinction of
party, in the same portion of our country, and that, <em>upon the present state
of the evidence</em>, we are forced most unwillingly to the sad conclusion
that the general community of the Slave States is in complicity in feeling
and principle with the system of intimidation and violence, for the
suppression of freedom of speech and of the press, of which the assault
on Senator Sumner is the most signal, but not the singular instance.
[<em>Applause.</em>] That we sincerely hope, that, on fuller and calmer consideration,
the public men and public press and the general community
of the Slave States will give us a distinct manifestation of their sentiments
which will enable us, too, to reconsider our present judgment.
[<em>Applause.</em>]”</p>

</div>

<p>At this meeting the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher spoke as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Had Mr. Sumner been a man of war, or a man of brawling words,
had he been any other than what he was, the case could not have been
so strong. I know not that there would have been found throughout
all the land one man so fit to be offered up as a sacrifice for Liberty,
a man so worthy to be offered up on the great altar of our country.
[<em>Applause.</em>] No aspiring politician has he been. His past career has
not been marked by ambitious clutchings. A lawyer by profession, but
a scholar by instinct,&mdash;a man of refined ideas, of social taste,&mdash;he
was seized by one of those sudden gusts of popular feeling which break
out occasionally in all our Free States, and elected to the Senate of the
United States. While his election was yet pending, I had the pleasure
of conversation with him in his office, I being a clergyman, and confessor
on that occasion [<em>laughter</em>], and he told me the secrets of his heart.
I am sure, that, although not without honorable and manly ambition,
this man had no desire for that position. Since he has been in Washington,
his course has been that which became a man, a Christian, a
gentleman, a statesman, and a scholar. He has everywhere not merely
observed the rules of decorum, but, with true chivalry, with the lowliest
gentleness, he has maintained himself void of offence, so that the
only complaint which I have ever heard of Senator Sumner has been
this, that he, by his shrinking and sensitive nature, was not fit for the
‘rough and tumble’ of politics in our day.&hellip;</p>

<p>“Mr. Sumner had no other weapon in his hand than his pen. Ah,
Gentlemen, here we have it! The symbol of the North is the pen; the
symbol of the South is the bludgeon.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span></p>
<p>At a public meeting in Canandaigua, of which Hon. Francis
Granger, Postmaster-General under President Harrison, was
Chairman, the following resolutions were adopted.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“1. <i>Resolved</i>, That in this premeditated and brutal attack upon
Senator Sumner, for words spoken by him in legislative debate, and in
the conscientious discharge of his public duty, we behold not only a
malignant outrage upon the person of a distinguished public servant,
but also a wanton violation of the right of freedom of speech,&mdash;a right
which is guarantied to every Representative, and through him to his
constituents, by the express provisions of the Constitution,&mdash;a right
without which the office of the legislator would be powerless and the
liberties of the people would become extinct, and which is therefore
‘inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.’</p>

<p>“2. <i>Resolved</i>, That, participating in the righteous indignation
which was recently expressed by thousands of freemen assembled in
the city of New York, ‘we discover no trace or trait, either in the
meditation, the preparation, or the execution of this outrage, which
should qualify the condemnation with which we now pronounce it
<em>brutal, murderous, and cowardly</em>.’</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<p>“5. <i>Resolved</i>, That to the Hon. Charles Sumner, the man of pure
and generous qualities, the accomplished scholar, the distinguished
lawyer, and the able and eloquent Senator, we respectfully and sincerely
offer our sympathies in the pain and peril which he has suffered
and is still suffering from this despicable assault; and we earnestly
hope that his restoration to health may be speedy and complete, and
that he may long be spared to vindicate the great popular rights at
which the blows inflicted upon him were aimed.”</p>

</div>

<p>At Providence, Rhode Island, there was a public meeting, in
which the most distinguished citizens took part. Among the
able speakers was the Rev. Dr. Hedge, who said, among other
things:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have heard of crimes which betoken greater pravity of heart,
but never have I heard or read of an act more flagitious in its open
defiance of sacred rights, in its ruthless disregard of all humane sentiment
and shameless violation of decency and order. We shall form a
more just conception of the outrage by viewing it abstractedly from any
interest we may feel in it as fellow-citizens of the parties concerned.
Suppose we had read, among the items of recent transatlantic intelligence,
that Count Buol, at the Peace Congress in Paris, offended by
some expression of the Earl of Clarendon, had felled him to the ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>with murderous blows. Imagine what a thrill of horror would have
struck through the heart of Europe, and how the wrath of the nations
would have chased the perpetrator of such an act from the face of the
earth. Or suppose Mr. Hume, of the British Commons, had entered
the House of Lords, and beaten Lord Brougham with a club until he
was borne senseless from the spot. “With what confidence should we
look to be advised by the next steamer that the culprit had been
doomed to expiate his crime by the direst penalty which the laws
of England have provided!&mdash;if, indeed, the English law has made any
provision for such a case, and not rather, as the law of the Roman
Commonwealth did the crime of parricide, left it unprovided for, as
an impossible, unsupposable enormity.</p>

<p>“One supposition more. Conceive the situation of the parties in the
case before us reversed. Suppose Senator Butler, who has said severer
things of Mr. Sumner than Mr. Sumner of him, to have been the
victim, and some member from Massachusetts, perhaps a far-away
cousin of Mr. Sumner, to have been the aggressor. Does any one here
present imagine that the ‘gallant relative’ in that case would be going
about unmolested on a paltry bail of five hundred dollars? If the
trusty bowie-knife or omnipresent revolver of Southern chivalry did
not otherwise dispose of him, does any one doubt that the summary
and prompt vengeance of Congress and the law would have been demanded
by one side and conceded by the other?”</p>

</div>

<p>Here is a brief extract from the speech of Rev. Dr. Wayland.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The question before us is simply, whether you, here and now,
consent to this change in our form of government, and accept the
position which it assigns to you,&mdash;and whether you agree to transmit
to your children this precious inheritance? For myself, I must decline
the arrangement. I was born free, and I cannot be made a slave.
I bow before the universal intelligence and conscience of my country,
and when I think this defective, I claim the privilege of using
my poor endeavors to enlighten it. But to submit my reason to the
bludgeon of a bully or the pistol of an assassin I cannot; nor can
I tamely behold a step taken which leads inevitably to such a consummation.</p>

<p>“You see that I consider this as a case of unusual solemnity. It
becomes us to deliberate wisely, to resolve in view of the future as
well as the past, and prepare ourselves to carry our resolutions out to
all their legitimate conclusions, and, in doing this, to pledge to each
other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>
<p>At a public meeting in Chapman Hall, Boston, immediately
after the assault, Wendell Phillips said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Nobody needs now to read this speech of Charles Sumner to know
whether it is good. We measure the amount of the charge by the
length of the rebound. [<i>Cheers.</i>] When the spear, driven to the quick,
makes the Devil start up in his own likeness, we may be sure it is the
spear of Ithuriel. [<i>Great applause.</i>] That is my way of measuring the
speech which has produced this glorious result. Oh, yes, glorious! for
the world will yet cover every one of those scars with laurels. [<i>Enthusiastic
cheering.</i>] Sir, he <em>must</em> not die! We need him yet, as the
vanguard leader of the hosts of Liberty. No, he shall yet come forth
from that sick-chamber, and every gallant heart in the Commonwealth
be ready to kiss his very footsteps. [<i>Loud cheers.</i>]</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<p>“Perhaps, Mr. Chairman and fellow-citizens, I am wrong; but I
accept that speech of my loved and honored friend, and with an
unmixed approbation,&mdash;read it with envious admiration,&mdash;take it all.
[<em>Cheers.</em>] Yes, what word is there in it that any one of us would
not have been proud to utter? Not one! [<em>Great applause.</em>] In utter
scorn of the sickly taste, of the effeminate scholarship, that starts back,
in delicate horror, at a bold illustration, I dare to say there is no
animal God has condescended to make that man may not venture to
name. [<em>Applause.</em>] And if any ground of complaint is supposable in
regard to this comparison, which shocks the delicacy of some men and
some presses, it is the animal, not Mr. Douglas, that has reason to
complain. [<em>Thunders of applause, renewed again and again.</em>]</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>

<p>“Mr. Chairman, there are some characters whose worth is so clear
and self-evident, so tried and approved, so much without flaw, that
we lay them on the shelf,&mdash;and when we hear of any act attributed to
them, no matter in what doubtful terms it be related, we judge the
single act by the totality of the character, by our knowledge of the
whole man, letting a lifetime of uprightness explain a doubtful hour.
Now, with regard to our honored Senator, we know that his taste,
intellect, and heart are all of this quality,&mdash;a total, unflawed gem;
and I know, when we get the full and complete report of what he said,
the <i>ipsissima verba</i> in which it was spoken, that the most fastidious
taste of the most delicate scholar will not be able to place finger on a
word of Charles Sumner which the truest gentleman would not gladly
indorse. [<em>Loud cheers.</em>] I place the foot of my uttermost contempt on
those members of the press of Boston that have anything to say in
criticism of his language, while he lies thus prostrate and speechless,&mdash;our
champion beaten to the ground for the noblest word Massachusetts
ever spoke in the Senate. [<em>Prolonged applause.</em>]”</p>

</div>

<p>A great meeting in Faneuil Hall was remarkable for the
speeches, of which a few extracts are given.</p>

<p>His Excellency, Henry J. Gardner, at the time Governor of
Massachusetts, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Were this a party occasion, my feet would not be upon this platform;
were this to stir up sectional animosity or promote local discord,
my voice would never reverberate from these arches above my head;
but when the State of Massachusetts is attacked in one of her dearest
rights, one of her most glorious privileges, I should be recreant to my
duty, I should be false to my trust, as every one who hears me would
be, did I not protest against this infraction of our common rights.
I wish, my friends, in order to give the greatest moral weight possible
to this meeting, to give its proceedings the most cogent force, to
assume in the outset that this case can in no wise, in no way, and
under no consideration, be considered anything but a spontaneous expression
of the sentiments of gentlemen of every party in the State of
Massachusetts upon this question. The last time the eloquent and
honorable Senator of Massachusetts addressed his fellow-citizens of
Boston, he stood where I now stand, on the eve of the election in
November last; and here, he being a Senator of Massachusetts in
the Congress of the United States, and I being Governor of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, he indulged in what he honestly believed
to be facts and statements in regard to those of my friends who were
striving to place me again in the post I then occupied, using no unfair,
but only honest statements of the views he held; and he being still a
Senator from Massachusetts, and I again her Governor, and this being
the first time since then that my voice has been heard in Faneuil
Hall, while I lament most deeply the circumstance which has called us
together, I rejoice that it gives me an opportunity to rise superior to
party feelings, to party bias, and to express my sentiments that we
must stand by him who is the representative of Massachusetts, under
all circumstances. [<em>Loud cheers.</em>] And while he represents the old
Commonwealth in the United States Senate, in the performance of his
constitutional duties as he understands them, I will, so help me
Heaven, do all in my humble ability to strengthen his arm and encourage
his heart. [<em>Loud applause.</em>]”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But now, when I read of this event in the Senate, of this assault
upon Sumner, it seemed to me it was a very bad specimen of a very
bad school. [<em>Laughter.</em>] And all of us were affected in the same manner,
upon reading the account. What was our first exclamation?
Not that it was an inhuman outrage, or a brutal outrage, but that it
was cowardly. I say that the cowardliness of this attack stands out
even more conspicuous, to my eye, than its brutality or its inhumanity.
To approach a man imprisoned, tied hand and foot, as it were,
between an arm-chair and a desk, and to strike him over the head
without warning or immediate provocation, a stunning, deadly blow
with a bludgeon, is, in my opinion, the act of an assassin. [<em>Applause.</em>]
And I say, that, compared to such an act, the act of the man who
meets me on the high-road, and horsewhips, or at least attempts to
horsewhip me [<em>laughter</em>], soars to something like manliness and courage.
[<em>Cheers.</em>]”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Peleg W. Chandler said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For more than twenty years, Mr. President and fellow-citizens, I
have been on terms of the closest intimacy with Charles Sumner. For
more than one half that period I have been his political opponent. It
is precisely because I have been, and now am, his personal friend, and
it is precisely because I have been, and now am, his political opponent,
that I have come here to-night,&mdash;not with the intention of speaking
upon this platform, but to listen to the voices of those who are his
political as well as personal friends, in relation to the great outrage
which has brought a stain upon our country.</p>

<p>“I have heard here, Gentlemen, a great deal of sympathy expressed
for Mr. Sumner. As his personal friend, I beg to say that that feeling
is entirely uncalled for, if not to some extent misplaced. Have sympathy
for the great martyrs of the past, for those who wear the civic
crown, if you will,&mdash;but I tell you that that gentleman in Washington
who now lies upon a bed of pain, whose life it may be is
hanging in the balance, needs no sympathy from us. Every drop of
blood shed by him in this disgraceful affair has raised up ten thousand
armed men. [<em>Applause.</em>] Every gash upon that forehead will be covered
with a political crown, let it be resisted as much as it may be
resisted, here or elsewhere. [<em>Loud cheers.</em>] This matter is raised
far above and beyond all personal considerations. It is a matter of
trifling consequence to Mr. Sumner. It makes those who love him
love him more,&mdash;and no man is more loved, or more to be considered,
so far as the affections or friendship are concerned. Yet personal
feelings are of little or no consequence in this outrage. It is a blow
not merely at Massachusetts, a How not merely at the name and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>fame of our common country; it is a blow at constitutional liberty
all the world over; it is a stab at the cause of Universal Freedom. It
is aimed at all men, everywhere, who are struggling for what we now
regard as our great birthright, and which we intend to transmit unimpaired
to our latest posterity. [<em>Loud cheers.</em>]</p>

<p>“Whatever may be done in this matter, however, one thing is certain,
one thing is sure. The blood of this Northern man, who had
dared to stand up in the Senate of the United States under circumstances
that would have discouraged a man of less ardor, less enthusiasm,
and less courage,&mdash;that blood now stains the Senate floor; and
let me tell you, that not all the water of the Potomac can wash it out.
They may cry, with the great tragic queen, ‘Out, damned spot!’ but
no water of this world can ever efface it. Forever, forever and aye,
that stain will plead in silence for liberty, wherever man is enslaved,
for humanity all over the world, for truth and for justice, now and forever.
[<em>Continued applause.</em>]”</p>

<p>The meeting at Cambridge was distinguished for the character
of those who took part in it, many of whom had not sympathized
with Mr. Sumner in his public life. The President was Hon.
Joel Parker, formerly Chief Justice of New Hampshire; and
among the Vice-Presidents were Theophilus Parsons, the eminent
law-writer,&mdash;C. C. Felton, afterwards President of Harvard University,&mdash;Jared
Sparks, the historian,&mdash;Henry W. Longfellow,&mdash;Charles
Beck, the Latin scholar,&mdash;Joseph E. Worcester, the
lexicographer,&mdash;Willard Phillips, the law-writer and judge,&mdash;Joseph
T. Buckingham, the well-known editor.</p>

<p>Professor Felton thus alluded to Mr. Sumner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I know Mr. Sumner well. In former times I had a long, an intimate,
and an affectionate acquaintance with him; and I feel bound
to say that he is a scholar of rich and rare acquirements, a gentleman
of noble qualities and generous aims, distinguished for the amenities
of social life, and a companion most welcome in the society of the
most generous, the most refined, the most exalted. Sir, I had nothing
to do with sending Mr. Sumner to the Senate of the United States; I
had no vote to cast on that occasion; and if I had had, it would not,
on public grounds, have been cast for him. I shall have none to cast,
when the time for another election comes; but if I had five hundred
votes, every one should be given to send him back again. [<em>Great
applause.</em>]</p>

<p>“Such is the man for whom ruffians lay in wait, whom they assaulted,
when unarmed and defenceless, in the Senate House.”</p>

</div>

<p>Richard H. Dana, Jr., Esq., made an elaborate speech, of which
the following is only an extract.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But I cannot, if I would, altogether withdraw my thoughts from

<div class="verse">‘He is my friend,&mdash;faithful and just to me.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I cannot allow myself to call up that scene in the Senate House, lest I
should feel more than I shall be able to express or be willing to betray.
Boston, his native town, has spoken. Next to Boston, there is
no place so dear to him as Cambridge. He is a true son of Harvard.
The best years of his early life, from fifteen to twenty-three, he spent
here: the four years of college,&mdash;a fifth year which he wisely, though
unusually, added to his course, for the perfecting of his classical and
general studies,&mdash;and the three years of his studies in the Law School.
At the Law School his attainments were not only great, but wonderful;
and for purity of character, kindness, and frankness, he was respected
and beloved by all. He was the friend, young as he was, the beloved
friend, the frequent and honored guest of Story, of Channing, and of
Allston. He was the companion of your Longfellow and your Felton.
No young man was more honored by Mr. Webster&mdash;in I had almost
said his better days. He was the friend of every man and of every
cause that deserved to have a friend. At the bar he distinguished himself,
especially in juridical literature. He was the reporter of Judge
Story’s decisions, and editor of the <i>Jurist</i>, where the young student
will find the copious results of his enthusiastic labors in his then beloved
profession. When he went abroad, he took nothing in his hand
that his own merits had not given him. He had not one claim that
did not rest on character, learning, and talents. Still under the age
of thirty, he became in Europe the honored friend of men whose names
have honored the world. Turning his back upon the attractions of dissipation
and fashion, he devoted himself to the society of the learned,
the wise, the philanthropic, and to all great and good objects. Thomas
Carlyle, in a letter to America, says, “We have had <em>popular Sumner</em>
here,”&mdash;so universally was he liked. In Paris, while the Northeastern
Boundary question was agitating England and America, and
attracting much of the attention of Europe, Sumner shut himself into
the libraries and public archives, and produced a treatise upon the
subject, thought then to be almost exhausted, which, published in the
great journals of Europe, and brought before Parliaments and Councils,
changed the aspect of the question in Europe, and redounded to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>great honor at home.</p>

<p>“After his return, under the influence of Dr. Channing, and in sympathy
with Dr. Howe and others, he devoted much of his time to the
great philanthropic and social problems of the day,&mdash;Slavery, Pauperism,
Crime, and Prison Discipline,&mdash;and gradually the overshadowing
social, political, and national importance of the Slave question drew
him first before the people and into public life. When his sentiments
on the Slave question were to be sustained at the risk of his ease, his
interests, his friendships, and his popularity, he put them all to the
hazard. When proposed as candidate for the Senate, the highest office
Massachusetts can give, while his election hung trembling in the balance
week after week, when one or two votes would secure it, and this
or that thing said or done it was thought would gain them, nothing
would induce Charles Sumner to take one step from his regular course
from his house to his office to speak to any man; he would not make
one bow the more, nor put his hand to a line, however simple or unobjectionable,
to secure the result. I know&mdash;I have right to say this&mdash;I
know that in this course he resisted temptations and advice and
persuasions which few men would not have yielded to. He was elected.
It was a tribute to character and talent.</p>

<p>“When he went to Washington, to fight almost alone, with only
two or three allies, discountenanced by colleagues and cried down by
the great majority, to fight the fight for Freedom, he determined not
to speak on the subject of Slavery until he had done all in his power
to secure the confidence and good-will of his opponents. So far did he
carry this, that his friends here feared that he was bending before the
idol, as others had bent. He secured his footing as well as it could be
secured. All but fanatics for Slavery admitted his claims to personal
affection and public respect. On this basis he took his stand for Freedom.
You have seen the result. Few men in America have ever had,
perhaps no one man now has, so many readers as he. His opponents
say that he burns the midnight lamp. He does. And</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘How far that little candle throws his beams!’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His opponents, too, burn the midnight lamp; but, as you remember,
Sir, the great Athenian said, there is a difference between the objects
on which their lamp throws its glare and his.”</p>

</div>

<p>Among the meetings, that of Concord deserves mention. The
resolutions, introduced by Hon. E. Rockwood Hoar, were as follows.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That we have heard with feelings of the deepest indignation
of the cowardly and brutal assault upon a Senator of Massachusetts,
in the Senate Chamber of the United States, for words spoken
in debate, in his place, upon the floor of the Senate.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That this dastardly outrage has in itself dishonored no one
but the ruffian who committed it,&mdash;but that the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States will make themselves accomplices
of the criminal, and deliberate partakers of the guilt and infamy of the
crime, if they shall fail to visit upon him speedy and condign punishment.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That, if there are those who imagine that the voice of a
Senator of Massachusetts can be silenced, or the expression of the deliberate
opinions of her people upon public measures and public men
can be stifled and suppressed, <em>by the terrors of assassination</em>, we <em>know</em>
that in <span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span> they have mistaken <em>the man</em>, and we will
endeavor to show that they have mistaken the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That, in this assault upon our distinguished Senator, the
right of free debate in Congress, guarantied by the Constitution of the
United States, has been dangerously assailed; and all men who are not
willing to see it wholly destroyed are called upon, personally, to rebuke
the outrage, and all its abettors, defenders, and apologists.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That we thank Mr. Sumner with our whole hearts for
his heroic defence of the Kansas settlers, and his solemn arraignment
before the country of the perpetrators of the great <em>Crime</em> against that
unhappy and conquered province.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That we have a right to look to the House of Representatives
to vindicate the honor of the country in the eyes of the civilized
world, by expelling from their body a member with whom none but
bullies and savages can hereafter fitly associate.”</p>

</div>

<p>These were followed by a speech from Ralph Waldo Emerson,
of which this is an extract.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The outrage is the more shocking from the singularly pure character
of its victim. Mr. Sumner’s position is exceptional in its honor.
He had not taken his degrees in the caucus and in hack politics. It
is notorious, that, in the long time when his election was pending, he
refused to take a single step to secure it. He would not so much
as go up to the State House to shake hands with this or that person
whose good-will was reckoned important by his friends. He was elected.
It was a homage to character and talent. In Congress he did not rush
into a party position. He sat long silent and studious. His friends,
I remember, were told that they would find Sumner a man of the
world, like the rest: ‘’Tis quite impossible to be at Washington and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>not bend; he will bend, as the rest have done.’ Well, he did not
bend. He took his position, and kept it. He meekly bore the cold
shoulder from some of his New England colleagues, the hatred of his
enemies, the pity of the indifferent, cheered by the love and respect of
good men with whom he acted, and has stood for the North, a little in
advance of all the North, and therefore without adequate support. He
has never faltered in his maintenance of justice and freedom. He has
gone beyond the large expectation of his friends in his increasing ability
and his manlier tone.</p>

<p>“I have heard that some of his political friends tax him with indolence
or negligence in refusing to make electioneering speeches, or
otherwise to bear his part in the labor which party organization requires.
I say it to his honor. But more to his honor are the faults
which his enemies lay to his charge. I think, Sir, if Mr. Sumner had
any vices, we should be likely to hear of them. They have fastened
their eyes like microscopes, now for five years, on every act, word, manner,
and movement, to find a flaw,&mdash;and with what result? His opponents
accuse him neither of drunkenness, nor debauchery, nor job,
nor peculation, nor rapacity, nor personal aims of any kind. No: but
with what? Why, beyond this charge, which it is impossible was ever
sincerely made, that he broke over the proprieties of debate, I find
him accused of publishing his opinion of the Nebraska conspiracy in
a letter to the People of the United States, with discourtesy. Then,
that he is an Abolitionist: as if every sane human being were not an
Abolitionist, or a believer that all men should be free. And the third
crime he stands charged with is, that his speeches were written
before they were spoken: which of course must be true in Sumner’s
case,&mdash;as it was true of Webster, of Adams, of Calhoun, of Burke, of
Chatham, of Demosthenes, of every first-rate speaker that ever lived.
It is the high compliment he pays to the intelligence of the Senate and
of the country. When the same reproach was cast upon the first orator
of ancient times by some caviller of his day, he said, ‘I should be
ashamed to come with one unconsidered word before such an assembly.’</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman, when I think of these most small faults as the worst
which party hatred could allege, I think I may borrow the language
which Bishop Burnet applied to Sir Isaac Newton, and say, that
Charles Sumner ‘has the whitest soul I ever knew.’</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
<p>“Well, Sir, this noble head, so comely and so wise, must be the
target for a pair of bullies to beat with clubs! The murderer’s brand
shall stamp their foreheads, wherever they may wander in the earth.
But I wish, Sir, that the high respects of this meeting shall be expressed
to Mr. Sumner, that a copy of the resolutions that have been
read may be forwarded to him. I wish that he may know the shudder
of terror that ran through all this community on the first tidings of
this brutal attack. Let him hear that every man of worth in New
England loves his virtues,&mdash;that every mother thinks of him as the
protector of families,&mdash;that every friend of Freedom thinks him the
friend of Freedom. And if our arms at this distance cannot defend
him from assassins, we confide the defence of a life so precious to all
honorable men and true patriots, and to the Almighty Maker of men.”</p>

</div>

<p>At a meeting in Worcester, Hon. Charles Allen, the eminent
Judge, and formerly a Representative in Congress, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now, Sir, we have met to express our warm feelings of indignation&mdash;at
what? That Charles Sumner has been stricken down by the
hand of a brutal ruffian? No, Sir: that is but a small portion of the
question which is presented for our consideration at this time. Not by
the hand of Brooks of South Carolina, alone, did he fall; but it was
through a <em>concerted effort</em>, which has not been denied in the House of
Representatives, although the question was evaded by Mr. Brooks, declaring
that he had informed no one of the <em>time</em> when it should take
place; but he did not deny&mdash;and it is well known in Washington, and
will be throughout the country, that this attack upon Mr. Sumner&mdash;that
this slaughter of Mr. Sumner, for such was the purpose&mdash;was
concerted among Southern men, and that Brooks was but the base instrument
by which the purpose was to be carried into effect. Sir, we
must hold, not Mr. Brooks responsible alone, but all those who combined
with him to do this foul deed,&mdash;all those&mdash;and you will find
there will be hosts in another section of the country&mdash;who will applaud
the act, and profess to honor the man who was put forward to
perpetrate this deed. And, Sir, if we consider it merely as a combination
of slaveholders against our Senator, and nothing more, we shall
not reach the magnitude of the question open for our consideration.
That blow was not meant for Mr. Sumner alone. It was meant for
the <em>State</em> which he represented. It was the State of Massachusetts
whose honor was outraged by that act. It was her majesty which was
stricken down in the person of her Senator. It is her body that lies
bleeding, and demands retribution at the hands of her children. Shall
retribution not come? Shall there not be a voice from one end of
Massachusetts to the other, calling aloud for retribution upon the perpetrator,
and the aiders and abettors of that foul act? [<em>Loud cries of
‘Yes,’ and applause.</em>]”</p>

<p>The voice of the Young Men of Boston found utterance at a
large and enthusiastic meeting of the Mercantile Library Association,
held at their rooms, June 6, 1856, when the following preamble
and resolutions were unanimously adopted.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Whereas</i> the Hon. Charles Sumner, Senator in Congress from
this Commonwealth, and an honorary member of this Association,
has been most brutally assaulted in his seat in Congress for words
uttered in debate: Therefore</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That it is with feelings of profound sorrow and shame
that we are obliged to recognize in this act a <em>cowardly</em> and <em>base</em> assault
upon the rights of free speech, and to regard this indignity, perpetrated
upon the person of our honored and beloved Senator, as an insult to the
city of Boston and its institutions, the State of Massachusetts, and our
common country.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the members of the Mercantile Library Association
of Boston, without distinction of party, most respectfully tender to the
Hon. Charles Sumner their kindest feelings of sympathy and esteem,
and earnestly hope, that, by the blessing of Divine Providence, he
may resume his seat in Congress, and reiterate those principles of
humanity which every institution, whether political or literary, should
most earnestly espouse.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Corresponding Secretary of this Association is
hereby requested to furnish the Hon. Charles Sumner with an appropriate
copy of these resolves.”</p>

</div>

<p>The sentiments of the medical profession appear in a speech
and toast by Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, at the dinner of the
Massachusetts Medical Society, at the Revere House, Boston.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Look into the chamber where our own fellow-citizen, struck down
without warning by the hand of brutal violence, lies prostrate, and
think what fearful issues hang on the skill or incompetence of those
who have his precious life in charge. One little error, and the <i>ignis
sacer</i>, the fiery plague of the wounded, spreads his angry blush over the
surface, and fever and delirium are but the preludes of deadlier symptoms.
One slight neglect, and the brain, oppressed with the products
of disease, grows dreamy, and then drowsy, its fine energies are palsied,
and too soon the heart that filled it with generous blood is still forever.
It took but a little scratch from a glass, broken at his daughter’s wedding,

almost at the very age of him for whose recovery we look, not without
anxious solicitude.</p>

<p>“At such a moment as this, more than at any other, we feel the
dignity, the awful responsibility, of the healing art. Let but that life
be sacrificed, and left unavenged, and the wounds of that defenceless
head, like the foul witch’s blow on her enchanted image, are repeated
on the radiant forehead of Liberty herself, and flaw the golden circlet
we had vainly written with the sacred name of Union!</p>

<p>Hon. Josiah Quincy, in the eighty-fifth year of his age, addressed
a letter to the Unitarian Festival, in which he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The hostile irruption of two members of Congress into the Senate
Chamber of the United States, openly armed with deadly bludgeons,
and probably secretly, according to the habits of their breed, with
bowie-knives and revolvers, and there prostrating on the floor with
their bludgeons a Senator of the United States, sitting peaceably in his
seat, unconscious of danger, and from his position incapable of defence,
inflicting upon him blows, until he sunk senseless under them, and
which, if they do not prove mortal, it was not for want of malignant intent
in the cowardly assassins,&mdash;and all this for words publicly spoken
in the Senate, in the course of debate, allowed by its presiding officer
to be spoken, <em>and exceeding not one hair’s breadth any line of truth or
duty</em>: this is the fifth, and the climax, of this series of outrages, unparalleled,
nefarious, and brutal.”</p>

</div>

<p>At an indignation meeting in the town of Quincy, this venerable
citizen spoke as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The blow struck upon the head of Charles Sumner did not fall upon
him alone. It was a blow purposely aimed at the North. It was a
blow struck at the very Tree of Liberty. It speaks to us in words not
to be mistaken. It says to us that Northern men shall not be heard
in the halls of Congress, except at the peril of the bowie-knife, the
bludgeon, and revolver. Nor is this any new thing.</p>

<p>“The bludgeon, heretofore only brandished, has at last been brought
down; and now is the time for the North to fight. Charles Sumner
needs not our sympathy: if he dies, his name will be immortal,&mdash;his
name will be enrolled with the names of Warren, Sidney, and Russell;
if he lives, he is destined to be the light of the nation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span></p>
<p>Hon. Edward Everett, at Taunton, opened his “Address on
the Character of Washington” by allusion to the assault.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“With the satisfaction which I feel in addressing you at the present
time are mingled the profoundest anxiety and grief. An irrepressible
sadness takes possession of my heart at the occurrences of the past
week, and the most serious apprehensions force themselves upon me
that events are already in train, with an impulse too mighty to be resisted,
which will cause our beloved country to weep tears of blood
through all her borders for generations to come. The civil war,&mdash;for
such it is,&mdash;with its horrid train of pillage, fire, and slaughter,
carried on, without the slightest provocation, against the infant settlements
of our brethren on the frontier of the Union,&mdash;the worse than
civil war which has for months raged unrebuked at the capital of the
Union, and has at length, by an act of lawless violence, of which I
know no parallel in the history of Constitutional Government, stained
the floor of the Senate Chamber with the blood of an unarmed, defenceless
man, and he a Senator of Massachusetts,&mdash;ah, my friends,
these are events which, for the good name, the peace, the safety of the
country, for the cause of free institutions throughout the world, it were
worth all the gold of California to blot from the record of the past
week. They sicken the heart of the good citizen, of the patriot, of the
Christian; they awaken a gloomy doubt whether the sacrifices and the
sufferings endured by our fathers, that they might found a purer,
higher, and freer civilization on this Western Continent than the world
had yet seen, have not been endured in vain.”</p>

</div>

<p>William H. Hurlbut, of New York, the eminent journalist,
wrote thus, under date of June 7, 1856.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The newspapers, which have for so long kept the millions of the
North as watchers about your bed, now gladden all our hearts with
the news that you are soon to stand again upon that floor which promises
to become as sacred in the annals of Freedom as is the arena of the
Coliseum in the story of our faith.&hellip;</p>

<p>“Nothing, I am sure, could so have touched and roused every class of
Northern society, nothing could so have put the terrible realities of
the issue we <em>must</em> confront before the most unwilling and the most indifferent
minds, as the atrocious deed which, imbecile as it was atrocious,
makes the firmest enemy of Slavery the perpetual representative
alike of Northern honor and of Northern manhood, and enlists around
you, as the perpetual Senator of Massachusetts, every instinct, passion,
and necessity of Northern civilization.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>

<p>“It is your rare good fortune to be able to wear the martyr’s crown
into the battle of life, and I really do not see how any true man can
have any words for you but those of congratulation and of stern exultation.
The scoundrelly simpleton who struck you fled from the recoil
of his weapon; but there will be a fiercer recoil from that blow, and a
flowing of blood not so easily to be stanched.</p>

<p>“In this season of our national degradation, it will be something,

<p>Dr. John W. Francis, the eminent physician, of New York,

sentiments I cherish in your behalf, and my admiration of your noble
patriotism and commanding eloquence. I had read carefully your
classical speeches, and rejoiced that there was at least one in the Senate
who to rich culture added the graces of finished oratory and the abiding
principles of constitutional freedom. Yes, my dear Sir, I have
been for several months, amidst many cares, absorbed on the consequences
which I inferred must follow the brutal assault which you
received. I almost at once exclaimed, That <em>blow</em> will effect a revolution
in our political relationship; yet I pray God that the Union may continue
intact under its momentous influences. You have, by your parliamentary
demonstrations, evinced the heroism of the patriots of the
earlier days of our Republic; you have stamped your Senatorial career
with the impress of the loftiest intrepidity and moral courage. You
are destined to occupy an ample page in your country’s history. These
expressions, dear Sir, flow from a full heart and a deep conviction.”</p>

<p>Governor Banks, in his annual message to the Legislature of
Massachusetts, January, 1858, associated the violence in Kansas
with that upon Mr. Sumner.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Nothing but the direct intervention of Federal influence can force
through Congress the Lecompton Constitution; and if the Government,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>with the sanction of the people, can force upon Kansas a Constitution
conceived in fraud and violence, it will be the weightiest blow ever
given against free governments.</p>

<p>“Violence and fraud, if successful in this instance, will be repeated
whenever occasion demands it. It will not be limited to Territories or
States. No shrine will be held sacred. The Senate Chamber of the
United States has been already invaded, and this State was for a time
bereft of a part of its representative power by an act of fearful wrong,
committed upon the most cherished and brilliant of her sons, while in
the performance of constitutional duty.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The wide-spread, spontaneous sentiment of the North found
echo in Europe, especially in England. Among various testimonies,
the following is selected from the <i>Morning Star</i> of London,
June 24, 1856.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The assault upon Mr. Sumner stands without parallel in the
annals of civilized communities. While sitting at his desk in the
Senate Chamber, quietly engaged in writing, a member of the other
legislative body, the House of Representatives, deliberately walks up to
him, and, taking advantage of his utterly helpless position, where he
could neither escape nor defend himself, begins to beat him violently
upon his bare head with a heavy cane, until he falls down stunned and
insensible, covered with his own blood, the cowardly ruffian not desisting
even then, when the form of his antagonist lay prostrate and senseless
before him. While this is taking place, a number of his brother
Senators stand round and make no attempt to stay the arm of the assailant;
some of them, indeed, mounted guard expressly to prevent interference.
Such conduct is utterly inexplicable to us in this country.</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<p>“If anything could aggravate the inherent brutality of this act, it
is the character of the man upon whom it was committed. For Mr.
Sumner is a gentleman in whom there meets a combination of qualities
adapted in a rare degree to inspire the affectionate attachment of
friends, and to command courtesy and respect from all generous and
honorable opponents: a man of a chivalrous and heroic spirit, of a refined
and sensitive nature, of a powerful and cultivated intellect disciplined
by hard study and adorned with profound and various learning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
who has led a life of irreproachable purity and active benevolence,&mdash;the
favorite pupil of Story, the intimate friend and disciple of Channing,
the chosen associate of the finest living minds of America, Quincy,
Sparks, Longfellow, Goodrich, Dana, Everett, Bryant, Emerson.</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<p>“And when the greatest of American orators and statesmen, Daniel
Webster, was stricken down by the hand of death, Mr. Sumner was
the man whom the State of Massachusetts chose from among her sons,
as most worthy to be his successor. And most nobly has he vindicated
the wisdom of their choice. Taking small interest in the ordinary
conflicts of parties, he has stood forth, from the moment that he
entered the Senate, as the courageous and resolute champion of the
slave. His speeches are elaborate and masterly orations, with perhaps
almost too much of classical stateliness and refinement for the tribune.
Over the hard and dry abstraction of politics he throws the glancing
lights of his fertile and polished fancy, and relieves the tedium of debate
by the rich stores of an elegant and varied erudition. The speech
that brought upon him the recent attack was perhaps the greatest of
all his efforts. It is in every respect a magnificent production. With
a lofty and relentless logic he tears away the covering veil of sophistry
with which the Southern members had sought to conceal the naked
iniquity of the transactions in Kansas. There are, no doubt, passages
of terrible severity, but not, we think, exceeding the license of parliamentary
debate among ourselves. And the most conclusive testimony
to the power of the orator is afforded by the desperate extremities to
which it reduced his discomfited foes.</p>

<p>“We have no words of commiseration to offer to Mr. Sumner. God
grant only that a life so valuable may be spared, and he will occupy
in the estimation of all men, at home and abroad, whose judgment he
would value, a prouder position than he ever occupied before. He
stood in the vanguard of Freedom, and the marks of the ruffianly outrage
inflicted upon him, which he will probably bear to the grave, he
will wear as more honorable scars than ever warrior brought from a
battle-field.”</p>

</div>

<p>This record of opinion at the North, echoed from Europe, may
be closed by words from an important journal at New York,
<i>The Courier and Enquirer</i>, in the summer of 1856.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“The fact is incontestable, that, when the Massachusetts Senator
again crosses the threshold of that Senate Chamber, Slavery will have
to confront the most formidable foe it ever had to face before the public
eye. He will come with every muscle braced and every sinew
strung by the sense of measureless personal wrong; but infinitely
more than that, he will come armed with the indignation and shielded
by the moral support of the whole North. Hitherto he has figured
but in one character, the assailant of Slavery; henceforth he will be
also the accredited assertor and champion of the most sacred right
of freedom of speech, and as such will command tenfold greater consideration.
His antagonists have affected to despise him before, and
to treat him with scorn. The day for that has passed. The public
man, who has once been the occasion of such an outburst of sympathy
and good-will as has within the last week sprung from the mouth of
millions upon millions of his countrymen, is no longer a man to be
disdained. He has henceforth position, power, and security, beyond
any of his adversaries. Let his sentiments be what they may, his free
utterance of them hereafter becomes an assured thing, insomuch as
that utterance will serve as the best of all possible tests of that freedom
of debate which has once been outraged in his person, and which
it is the present determination of the North shall be maintained at all
hazards.”</p>

<h3>V.<br />
INJURIES AND CONTINUED DISABILITY OF
MR. SUMMER.</h3>

<p>Senator Butler, in reply to Mr. Sumner, June 12, 1856, remarked
on his absence from his seat as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If I give credence to the testimony of Dr. Boyle, I see no reason
why he should not be present. For anything that appears in that
testimony, if he had been an officer of the Army, and had not appeared
the next day on the battle-field, he would have deserved to be
cashiered.”<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This fling was so agreeable to the Senator that he repeated it,
with a variation, on the second day of his speech.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After all that has been said and done, on a <i>post bellum</i> examination,
what is it? A fight in the Senate Chamber, resulting in two
flesh wounds, which ought not to have detained him from the Senate.
Being rather a handsome man, perhaps he would not like to expose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>himself by making his appearance for some time; but if he had been
in the Army, there was no reason why he should not go to the field
the next day; and he would deserve to be cashiered, if he did not
go.”<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

</div>

<p>After such remarks in open Senate, it was easy for the press in
sympathy with Slavery to assert that Mr. Sumner had received
no injury, and that his reported disability was a pretence for the
benefit of his political party.</p>

<p>At the time of the assault Mr. Sumner was in perfect health,
without any weakness or disturbing incident. Having confidence
in the native force of his constitution, he looked forward
to a very early restoration, thinking that the injuries he had received
would yield easily to Nature. His disappointment affords
another instance of the extent to which patients are deceived
with regard to their true condition, which in his case was revealed
tardily. He had hoped to resume his seat in a few days.
Months and years passed, leaving him an invalid.</p>

<p>On the healing of the flesh wounds, he found himself still a
sufferer from a pressure on the brain, with weakness in the
spinal column. The latter became more positive with time.
First a guest of F. P. Blair, Esq., at Silver Spring, near Washington,
he was able early in July to reach Philadelphia, where he
found rest at the house of Rev. William H. Furness. Here he
came under the medical care of Dr. Caspar Wister. From Philadelphia
he went to Cape May, where he was welcomed by the
family of James T. Furness, Esq., at their cottage. Here he was
very feeble, so that his kind hosts were alarmed with regard to
him. From Cape May he went to Cresson, an elevated place in
Pennsylvania, where he stayed with Dr. R. M. Jackson. Once
more in Philadelphia at the beginning of September, he was
welcomed by his hosts of Cape May, with whom he remained
until his return to Boston at the beginning of November. This
return was postponed by the advice of his physician, who was
unwilling that he should expose himself to the excitement of
such an event.</p>

<p>In Boston he was treated by Dr. Marshall S. Perry, in consultation
with the venerable physician, Dr. James Jackson. Here
he remained several months, most of the time in the h<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>ouse, on
his bed. He did not reach Washington until just before the
close of the session of Congress, but in season to determine by his
vote the fate of the tariff of 1857.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> On the 4th of March he was
sworn as Senator for the second term, and on the 7th of March
sailed for Havre in the Steamer Fulton. Still confident in his
recuperative force, and underrating his injuries, his object was
simply rest and recreation, rather than medical treatment. After
some time in Paris, he travelled in France, Switzerland, England,
and Scotland, including a stay in London. While in Edinburgh he
became acquainted with George Combe, the eminent phrenologist
and physiologist, who, taking a strong interest in his case, wrote
to Sir James Clark, the Queen’s physician, for his opinion upon it.
The two united in advising against an early return to public duties;
but Mr. Sumner felt constrained to try himself at Washington.
Accordingly he resumed his seat at the beginning of the session,
in December, 1857, only to find himself within the circumscriptions
of an invalid. Without pretending to take part in business,
he sought to be at hand to vote on important questions. At
last he was admonished by a succession of relapses that he must
make a more serious effort for recovery. On the 22d May, 1858,
just two years from his original injuries, he sailed in the steamer
Vanderbilt for Havre. His first purpose was to visit Switzerland,
and there commence pedestrian exercise in the open air, beginning
with a short distance and extending it daily, as the athlete,
beginning with the calf, at last carried the ox; but this idea proceeded
on a radical misconception of his case, which required repose
rather than exercise. A medical friend to whom he communicated
this plan warned him against it, saying, curtly, “Then
you’ll be a dead man!”</p>

<p>At Paris he first enjoyed the advice of Dr. George Hayward,
the eminent surgeon of Boston, but soon afterward came under the
care of that remarkable physiologist and specialist, Dr. Brown-Séquard,
who, after a most careful diagnosis, reported that the
blows on the head had taken effect, by <i>contre-coups</i>, in the spine,
producing disturbance in the spinal cord. To Mr. Sumner’s instant
inquiry as to the remedy, the Doctor replied, “Fire.” The
resolution of the former was taken at once, and he asked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span> “When
can you apply it?” “To-morrow, if you please,” said the Doctor.
“Why not this afternoon?” said the patient; and that afternoon
it was done by the <i>moxa</i>, which was followed by other
applications, being seven in number, always without chloroform,
which Mr. Sumner declined to take. This was in June. During
this painful treatment he found solace in the study of engravings,
to which he devoted himself, according to the limitations of his
health, with daily assiduity.</p>

<p>Some time in August he left Paris for the baths of Aix, in
Savoy, famous from antiquity, where he underwent still another
treatment by hot and cold <i>douches</i>. Then traversing Switzerland,
he entered Germany by Venice and Trieste, visiting Vienna,
Berlin, and Munich. Reaching Paris in November, he was
arrested in his proposed return to the Senate by a medical conference,
in which Dr. Brown-Séquard, Dr. George Hayward, and
the eminent French practitioner, Dr. Trousseau, took part, all
uniting against it. Leaving the excitements of Paris, he passed
the ensuing winter at Montpellier, in the South of France. Here
he led a retired life, being cupped on the spine daily, and passing
as many as eighteen hours out of the twenty-four on the bed or
sofa, finding recreation in reading, and, so far as he could, in the
public lectures at the college on history and literature. Taking
advantage of his improved condition in the spring, he made a
hurried visit to Italy, and then reported himself to Dr. Brown-Séquard
at Paris, who pronounced him well. To the various
treatments already mentioned he added sea-baths at Havre during
the following August. At the opening of Congress in December,
1859, he was in his seat, with a certain consciousness
of restored health, although admonished to enter upon work
slowly.</p>

<p>Contemporary reports in newspapers and letters illustrate the
condition of Mr. Sumner at the time, and something of his frame
of mind.</p>

<p>A correspondent of the Boston <i>Telegraph and Chronicle</i>, under
date of February 20, 1857, shows his occupations at the time he
was struck down.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was my good fortune to be a frequent caller upon Mr. Sumner
during his residence here. I always found him studiously devoted
to the duties of his office. He was one of the most active, hard-working
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>men in Congress. Down to the 22d day of May, 1856, when he
was so brutally assailed by the agent of the Slave Oligarchy, he had
never been out of his seat a single day. It was in this spirit of fidelity
that he always discharged his duties. If I may be pardoned in the
exhibition of a little selfishness, I will acknowledge that it was in part
the discovery of the fact that Mr. Sumner kept a better run of all the
public business before Congress than most other members, that induced
me, as a member of the press, to make more frequent calls upon him
than perhaps I should otherwise have done. He was particularly well
posted on all questions of foreign affairs, from the reception of Kossuth
down to the important part that he took in the Sound Dues of Denmark;
he was always enlightened on all propositions of general legislation,
touching the judiciary, commerce, patents, the tariff, and everything
concerning the great interests of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>“At the time he was disabled, the Journal of the Senate will show a
large number of special propositions introduced by him, among which
was the proposition he has brought forward annually for the revision
and consolidation of the Statutes of the United States, which must yet
prevail; also for cheap ocean postage, another annual proposition;
also for post-office orders, as a mode of transfer of money in small sums
for the accommodation of the poor,&mdash;an idea recently adopted by the
House Committee on Post-Offices and Post-Roads; several propositions
of amendment of Patent Law, particularly one to take off the heavy
fees on foreign patents, in order to pave the way for a similar reduction
abroad; a bill altering the Commercial Law, so as to relieve ship-owners
of liability in the case of fire under certain circumstances; a
bill amending the Law of Copyright; a bill providing for the regulation
of passengers coming into the United States; also a whole group
of bills for the improvement of the rivers and harbors of Massachusetts,
for the building of a Court-House and Post-Office at Boston,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>“None, except those who have had experience in Washington, and
have had an inside view of the practical life of a Congressman, can
form a correct idea of the vast amount of labor performed by them
which does not appear before the public. Mr. Sumner’s correspondence
was one of the largest in the Senate,&mdash;not confined to Massachusetts,
but coming from every part of the country. He neglected nothing.”</p>

</div>

<p>While Mr. Sumner was at Cresson, Mrs. Swisshelm, who saw
him there, wrote a long letter on his condition, addressed to the
<i>New York Tribune</i>, under date of August 23, 1856, which con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>tained
the following.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He has all the impatience of ordinary men in illness, or in the
prospect of restraint, and assures everybody that he is doing very well,
feels very well, is quite strong, and will surely be able to go to Washington
in two weeks. Mr. Burlingame assures me, with tears in his
eyes, that this is what he always said. Ever since his injury he has
been going to be quite well in two weeks; but when he rises from his
chair, he takes hold of the table. His gait, at a first glance, appears
that of a man of ninety years of age; but, watching him awhile, I felt
that it was the very kind of step one takes when creeping through a
darkened chamber under the influence of a paroxysm of nervous headache;
but he says, with a kind of lofty, incredulous scorn, that his
head does not ache! Sometimes he feels a <em>pressure</em> on the top of his
head, and it appears to hurt him when he walks; but he will be ready
to go to Washington in two weeks.</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<p>“Mr. Burlingame came on Friday evening, about six o’clock, in company
with a gentleman and lady from Philadelphia. He had not before
seen Mr. Sumner since the Brooks challenge, and we all sat together
until after eleven o’clock,&mdash;there was so much to be told, and
said, and explained. Without any personal resemblance, these two
appeared together like father and son; but I could give no idea of
their interview, even so much of it as the sacredness of private conversation
would permit to be made public, in less than a column, and
Mr. Sumner crowds everything from my thoughts just now. When his
friends left, he had no disposition to retire, and when he did, slept but
one hour.</p>

<p class="center">&hellip;</p>

<p>“Those mistaken friends of his who would fain see Brooks killed or
maimed would greatly distress him, if any such killing or maiming
were done by their agency. He shudders at the thought that Burlingame
might have shot him, and appears to feel about as much resentment
against him as I should feel toward a tile which had fallen upon
my head. I could not discern the slightest symptom of chagrin or
mortification,&mdash;no sense of the dishonor which so many attach to the
blow unrevenged.</p>

<p>“I asked him if he would have defended himself, if it had been
possible?</p>

<p>“‘Most certainly,’ was the prompt reply, ‘to the best of my ability,
and the last extremity.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span></p>

<p>“To Dr. Jackson’s suggestion, that the same principle which permitted
him to defend himself, when attacked, should induce him to
punish the offence, he promptly explained the difference between self-defence
and revenge. He appears to have no idea, however remote, of
personal enmity in the matter,&mdash;but if he was only able to deliver one
more speech! His brain is throbbing with pent thunderbolts,&mdash;and
if he could only get into the citadel of his foes, and hurl them hissing
into their faces! Kansas, Kansas and her wrongs, if he could but
fight her battles! He does not appear as if he knew how to be afraid,
or could learn, if he tried for a lifetime. There is a lion look about him,
and a courage which could not stoop to assault so frail a thing as a
human body.”</p>

</div>

<p>A correspondent of the <i>Springfield Republican</i>, after describing
a visit to Mr. Sumner, reports, under date of February 8, 1857:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I ventured after a time to speak to him of the outrage from whose
effects came this sad weakness, and to express a wonder which I have
always felt that serious commotions did not follow it. ‘Oh, no,’ he
said. ‘It was little, in comparison with daily occurrences. The poorest
slave is in danger of worse outrages every moment of his life.’”</p>

</div>

<p>A correspondent of the <i>Boston Traveller</i> reports, under date of
February 20, 1858:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Much interest is felt, I find, among our friends in Massachusetts
and elsewhere, to know the nature of Mr. Sumner’s feelings toward the
person who inflicted upon him so great a calamity, taking from him
nearly two years of active life, and putting in jeopardy both his life
and reason. Sharing this feeling, I have endeavored to learn the Senator’s
sentiments on the subject. Yet I have never heard him utter one
word from which I could even found a conjecture of them, though the
matter has been referred to by myself, and by others in my hearing, in
the course of conversation. Moreover, I have heard his private secretary,
who was his nurse and watcher during the long, sultry days and
nights of his illness in Washington, remark that he had never heard
the Senator speak of the assault or the assailant, or in any way express
any feeling on the subject. But I presume, however, that the feelings
of Mr. Sumner are justly excited against the cruel Slave Power, which
originally instigated and has since sanctioned the assault.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner was constantly wrestling with his disability, and
impatient under the necessary constraint. He longed to be at
work. Here friends exerted an adverse pressure.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>
<p>Wendell Phillips wrote from Nahant, under date of July 13,
1856:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The rumor is, on all sides, that you purpose returning as soon as
possible to your seat. Allow me, as a most near friend, careful alike
of you and the cause, to urge you not to attempt taking your seat
again this session. No such step is necessary. Every one here recognizes
most fully and heartily your fearless devotion. Every one is
more than ready, anxious, to wait till confirmed health and strength
make it, not an effort, but a pleasure, for you to return to your place.
The only fear is lest you be tempted to hurry back before your strength
is fully restored. Nothing you can do will shut the mouths of journals
whose trade is lying and abuse. It is fair to say, and a hopeful
sign of the times also, that these cavils fall to the ground utterly
ineffectual and harmless. At least their only result is indignation.
Let this session go by. Be sure Massachusetts will give you six
more years to work in. You have done more than your share in this
session’s fight,&mdash;enough to satisfy the most impatient spirit. Come
home and rest. Come home to recruit for years and a crisis when we
shall need you even more than now,&mdash;when your voice will be worth
more, far more, than even now. The most ardent wish of all who
love you is that you <em>consider yourself</em>: in so doing <em>now</em> you best serve
the cause.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Schuyler Colfax wrote from Washington, under date of
July 21, 1856:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We miss you here very much, and, as I pass your recent lodgings,
I often regret that I cannot run up and bore you with a few minutes’
talk; but I think, and such is the general feeling of all your friends,
that you ought not to think of resuming your seat this session. The
weather and the excitement will both be against you, if you do.</p>

<p>“Besides, next December you can resume that expressively vacant
seat with the proud consciousness that the wand of the Oligarchy is
broken,&mdash;or, if a different fortune is reserved for us, which I pray God
to avert, to head the forlorn hope which is then to battle for the Right
against the Furies which the triumph of the Wrong will let loose on us
all. But you know best, and I will not presume to advise.</p>

<p>“I was glad to hear the report of your Philadelphia physician,
which relieved the forebodings which I fear were preying on you; and
it confirms what an eminent physician wrote me, that the action of the
absorbent vessels would relieve you slowly, if you would abstain from

is most <em>positive</em> and <em>earnest</em> in his <em>opinion</em> that you should <em>remain</em>

Oligarchs and Serviles once more cowering under your rebukes of despotism

<p>“It is amazing to see to what depths of baseness some of the partisan
presses in the interest of the Oligarchy will descend. Not content

<p>“We are all anxious about you. Get well, if possible, and do not

require it, and let the next session go. Our friends will stand by you,
if you do not feel able to take your seat next session. I feel confident
that our friends desire above all things that you shall be able to keep

conducive to the recovery of your health. If your health will be improved
by continuing in Europe for months longer, pray take the time.
This is my advice to you. I hope, however, you will be able to return

<p class="center">“CASE OF HON. CHARLES SUMNER.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p class="center">“Read before the Boston Society for Medical Improvement, December 15, 1856.</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">By Marshall S. Perry, M. D., of Boston.</span></p>

<p>“The assault was made upon Mr. Sumner in the Senate of the
United States, on Thursday, May 22d. The first blow produced insensibility.
It is not certain how many blows he received: they were
many. He bled profusely, and fell insensible on the floor. When he
was removed to the anteroom, it was thought he could not survive.
His wounds were dressed by Dr. Boyle. He had two gashes on the
back of the head, one above each ear, about two or two and a half
inches in length. These gashes went through the scalp to the bone,
which was laid bare, but it is supposed not fractured. Besides these, he
had bruises on the face, on the back of each hand, and on the arms.</p>

<p>“From the time of the attack until the Monday following, no serious
symptoms manifested themselves, except some pain and soreness in the
head, and nervousness. Tuesday morning he had more pain, and in
the afternoon he was quite feverish. During the night the pain became
very violent, and when I saw him, early on Wednesday, for the
first time professionally, he had a high fever, pulse 104, intense pain
in the head, eyes suffused, and extreme nervousness. The scalp above
the right ear was inflamed, having the appearance of erysipelas. This
inflammation extended to the glands of the neck, which were swollen and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>tender to the touch. On examination, it was found that pus had
formed under the scalp, which escaped readily on opening the wound,
which had been closed over with collodion by Dr. Boyle. Mr. Sumner
had suffered so much during the last ten hours, that he had become
very much exhausted. He was put under the influence of opium, the
wound was poulticed, and perfect rest enjoined. For three days he
was in a critical situation. The local inflammation, the danger of poison
from the absorption of pus, and the extreme nervous exhaustion
made it a formidable case. At the end, however, of this time, he appeared
to be out of immediate danger.</p>

<p>“The wound on the left side of the head healed by first intention.
It was several weeks before that on the right side closed over. During
this time he was very weak, had some fever, especially when excited,
and was confined mostly to his bed. He did not at that time complain
of much pain in his head, but, as the wound healed after several weeks,
he had neuralgic pain in the back of the head, coming on in paroxysms.
As these passed away, he had a feeling of oppressive weight or pressure
of the brain, which was increased when excited or engaged in conversation.
He described it as “a fifty-six pounds weight” upon his head.
At the same time he lost flesh and strength, his appetite was irregular,
and his nights wakeful,&mdash;sometimes lying awake all night, or, when
sleeping, disturbed. He had also increased sensibility of the spinal cord,
and a sense of weakness in the small of the back. These were developed
by walking, and every step he took seemed to produce a shock upon
the brain. His walk was irregular and uncertain, and after slight efforts
he would lose almost entire control of the lower extremities.</p>

<p>“In this condition he was advised by Dr. Lindsly, of Washington, to
remove from that place to some more quiet spot. He accordingly came
to Philadelphia, and there called upon Dr. Wister for advice. Mountain
air and complete seclusion were recommended; but Mr. Sumner
undertook first to try the sea air, and went to Cape May. Here he
was very weak, so that he was unable to bathe, and he finally left without
any sensible improvement. On the recommendation of Dr. Wister,
he went to Cresson, in the Alleghany Mountains. While there he was
in the family of Dr. R. M. Jackson, and under his medical direction.</p>

<p>“The following letters, received from Drs. Wister and Jackson, describe
Mr. Sumner’s condition while under their care.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“‘<span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>, Oct. 14, 1856.</p>

<p class="noindent">“‘<span class="smcap">Dr. M. S. Perry</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;It gives me much pleasure to reply to your note of inquiry
concerning the health of Mr. Sumner.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>

<p>“‘You are perfectly aware of the condition of Mr. Sumner when he
reached this city on the 9th of July,&mdash;a condition of extreme nervous exhaustion,
his circulation feeble, and in fact every vital power alarmingly
sunken. At that time his steps were feeble and tottering, as in extreme old
age; he complained of constant pain in the back and lower extremities,&mdash;in
the latter it was a tired and weary sensation; and he had a sense of constriction
and pressure about the head. At that time his pulse was quick and
small, appetite languid, and his sleep broken, disturbed, and unrefreshing.
All the above conditions were heightened by exertion, either mental or
physical. I could find no evidence of organic disease. I understood Mr.
Sumner to be in that state of extreme nervous exhaustion from which men
are months, and at times even years, in being fully restored.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Sumner has done eminently well. His present state is but a
shadow of that above described; and although none of the features of the
past are lost, they are only evident when imprudent exertion, mental or
physical, shall call them up. Within the limits of exertion of an ordinary
retired gentleman, Mr. Sumner improves daily, and all his powers improve,
with a steady progress towards perfect health. Indiscretion brings on morbid
wakefulness, and, in the recurring outline of his former condition, admonishes
him, that, though recovering, he is still in risk.</p>

<p class="sig2">“‘With much respect, truly yours,</p>

<p class="center">“LETTER FROM DR. JACKSON.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>“‘You ask for a brief report of the case of the Hon. Charles Sumner, as it
came under my observation during his visit and stay on the Alleghany
Mountain in Pennsylvania. Mr. Sumner came to Cresson on the 3d of August
last. On his arrival, he had the appearance of a man who had been
sick for a long time, and was still extremely unwell. Careful observations
and examinations of the case, for some time, revealed the following appearances
and symptoms.</p>

<p>“‘The lips were pale, showing a watery condition of the blood, evinced
also by general pallor of the countenance and flabbiness of the solids. The
action of the heart and arteries was weak, the pulse being slow and languid.
On the surface of the head the integuments showed a slight redness around
the cicatrices of the recently healed cuts,&mdash;also some morbid sensibility on
pressure. Efforts at walking gave a tottering and uncertain gait, as if from
partial paralysis (say threatened paraplegia),&mdash;the steps being short and
unsteady, the muscles evidently not under the complete control of the will,
the limbs even giving way partially. The slightest exertion was followed
by lassitude quite disproportioned to the efforts. His nights were frequently
passed in a state of morbid wakefulness and general uneasiness. The action
of the brain was always followed by a sense of weight and dull throbbing
pain in the head. This result invariably followed even the slightest
mental effort of writing a common letter of business.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>

<p>“‘The entire chain of symptoms soon pointed to the head and spine as
the seat of a highly morbid condition. The contents of the other cavities of
the body seemed normal. As no regular medical report had been given me
of the case before its arrival at the Mountain, its original condition after the
assault had to be inferred from present inspection, without the history of its
progress. From this it was clearly evident that the brain and spinal cord
had been the seat of a grave and, formidable lesion. As the first violent
symptoms had passed off, the consequences of which, veiled and obscure,
were the only evidence by which the case could be read, it was clearly
apparent that its present pathological condition was of a most serious character,
and had been preceded by impending danger to life. From all the
facts it was evident that from the blows upon the skull there must have
been either congestion, or concussion followed by congestion, or positive inflammation
of the brain or its investing membranes, in this case. Actual
fracture is not at all necessary to this result. In Hope’s Pathological Anatomy
we have the following statement: “In several cases of fracture of the
skull, and in some of injury of the scalp alone (!), I have found pus, either
liquid or of a pasty consistence, between the bone and the dura mater, and
adhering to both.” Thus inflammation and its products on the interior of
the skull proceed from “<em>injuries of the scalp alone</em>.” The injury occurring
in a subject of a highly impressible and delicate nervous temperament, at a
time in which the central organ of the nervous system was exhausted by
excessive mental tension for days and nights of severe effort, carried with it
impending destruction. The insidious danger of the first injury was <em>now</em>
only to be estimated by its threatening consequences at the stage of progress
of the case when it arrived at the Mountain. All too plainly marked by
fearful features the true character of the effects of the assault in the Senate,
and plainly showed their fatal tendencies in the condition of the man. At
this stage of the case, whatever might have been or might now be the condition
of the suffering internal organs, debility and exhaustion of life was
manifestly the clearest phenomenon visible.</p>

<p>“‘This was accompanied with an interrupted action of the muscles of
voluntary motion, great weakness of the loins, inability to protract beyond
a few minutes any mental effort without pain, weight and uneasiness in the
head, together with soreness in the region of the cervical vertebræ; all of
which symptoms, taken together, demonstrate a case ravaged by severe disease
in the great nervous centre, and showing in that region still a highly
pathological condition of parts. All the symptoms being of a depressed
order, exhaustion and weakness predominating in all the functions, the clear
indication in the case was to reënergize the man in every way and by every
influence. This, it seemed, would be most effectually secured by a judicious
diet, mild tonic agents, constant exercise in the open air on horseback
or in a carriage, and by cessation of all active efforts of the diseased parts,
and a gradual stringing up and intonation of the whole body under the influence
of mountain air, mountain water, and change of climate. Within
five weeks, the effects of this treatment were marked and clearly visible to
all. So emphatic were they in the consciousness of Mr. Sumner, that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>could not be persuaded he was still an invalid, and not almost well and
ready for the field of active operations. He left the Mountain prematurely,
before he was hardened and his body restored to its normal tone. This was
done contrary to my urgent advice and entreaties. It was clearly apparent,
that, with one more month of the bracing influences of the Mountain, he
would have been much better than at present, and the perfect final restoration
of the Senator’s health greatly facilitated.</p>

<p class="sig2">“‘Yours truly,</p>

<p class="sig3">“‘<span class="smcap">R. M. Jackson</span>.</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Cresson</span>, Nov. 12, 1856.’</p>

</div>

<p>“Since Mr. Sumner’s return to Boston, he has been gradually improving.
He has followed a rigid system of exercise in the open air,
and carefully avoided all intellectual excitement. The pressure in his
head, or sensation of weight, which formerly came on after the slightest
mental or physical exertion, and which was very oppressive, is now
felt only after great fatigue, or considerable effort of the mind. He
still complains, after sitting up for a long time, of pain in his back;
and when he rises from his bed or chair, he finds at first some difficulty
in using the muscles of the lower extremities, but after walking
a short time they become quite flexible and under the complete control
of the will. His appetite is good, he sleeps much better than he did,
and is gaining flesh and strength. I see no reason why he may not entirely
recover, unless he allows himself too soon to enter upon his Senatorial
duties. He has already assumed the external appearance of
health. Time and mental repose will do the rest.</p>

<p>“I think it is impossible to decide with absolute certainty what the
pathological condition of Mr. Sumner’s brain has been; but I am inclined
to the opinion of Dr. Jackson, ‘that the brain, as well as the
spinal cord, has been the seat of some serious lesion.’ The long continued
sense of weight in his head, the pain along the spine, the partial
loss of power in the lower extremities, the loss of flesh during the
first three months after the attack, and the wakefulness, without any
affection of the mind, would lead, I think, to this conclusion. Had the
patient died, a <i>post-mortem</i> examination would have determined conclusively
the character of the injury; but we can only make an approximation
to a true appreciation of the case by a cautious interpretation of
the symptoms.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This diagnosis does not extend beyond December, 1856. Subsequent
newspapers contain notices of the case. The diagnosis, at a
later day, by Dr. Brown-Séquard, has never been published.</p>

<p>On the 3d of June, 1856, a resolution for the relief of Kansas failed
in the Massachusetts Legislature, mainly, it was alleged, through the
hostility of Governor Gardner. On the next day a message from the
Governor was received by the Legislature, recommending the payment
of the expense of the illness of Mr. Sumner. This was followed in the
Senate by a resolution to the same effect. On learning these proceedings,
Mr. Sumner dictated the following telegraphic despatch, which

<p>Immediately after the assault on Mr. Sumner a subscription was

follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Being desirous of expressing to the Hon. Charles Sumner, in some permanent

approbation of his speech in behalf of Free Kansas, delivered in the Senate
on the 20th of May last,&mdash;a speech characterized by comprehensive knowledge
of the subject, by logical acuteness, and by Spartan intrepidity in the
chastisement of iniquity, for which he has wellnigh lost his life at the
brutal and cowardly hands of the creature for which (thanks to the rarity
of its appearance) the English tongue has as yet no appropriate name,&mdash;we
deem it alike a privilege and an honor to participate in offering him
some suitable token of our sentiments. For this purpose we subscribe the
sums set opposite our names.”</p>

</div>

<p>Among the early signers were the venerable Josiah Quincy, Henry
W. Longfellow, Jared Sparks, F. D. Huntington, R. H. Dana, Jr.,
Edward Everett, Edwin P. Whipple, Alexander H. Rice, Charles Hudson,
Charles Francis Adams, Nathaniel B. Shurtleff, Charles A. Phelps,
Amasa Walker, William Claflin, Eli Thayer, and George Bliss.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner was on his bed when he heard of this purpose. He at
once dictated the following letter.</p>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, June 13, 1856.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;The papers speak of a token

speech exposing the <em>Crime against Kansas</em>. Pardon
me, if, in advance of any direct information, I say to
you frankly that I cannot allow this flattering project<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
to proceed further.</p>

<p>It is enough for me that you and your generous
associates approve what I said. Such sympathy and
support in the cause, of which I am a humble representative,
is all that I ask for myself, or am willing to
accept. But the cause itself has constant claims on us
all. And I trust you will not deem me too bold, if I
express a desire that the contributions intended for the
testimonial to me may be applied at once, and without
abatement of any kind, <em>to the recovery and security of
Freedom in Kansas</em>.</p>

<p>For this I spoke in the Senate, and I shall be proud
to regard these contributions thus applied as my words
hardened into deeds.</p>

<p class="sig">Believe me, my dear Sir, with much regard,</p>

<p class="sig2">Very faithfully yours,</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>This letter was laid before a meeting of the subscribers in Mercantile
Hall, with Rev. F. D. Huntington, afterwards Bishop of the Western
Diocese of New York, in the chair. A contemporary newspaper records
what ensued.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A beautiful design of the testimonial which it had been proposed to
offer Mr. Sumner was also submitted to the meeting. It was to have been
a massive and elaborate silver vase, two feet in height, and was planned by
Messrs. Bailey, Kettell, and Chapman. Upon its summit was a figure
representing Charles Sumner holding his Kansas speech in his right hand.
On either side were the figures of Justice and Freedom, crowning him with
a wreath of laurels. A winged genius sits at his feet, and is inscribing his
name on a tablet. Figures representing Victory are upon the arms of the
vase, heralding the triumph of Freedom. Above the inscription to Mr.
Sumner, and in the centre, was the coat of arms of Massachusetts. On the
foot of the vase was the coat of arms of the nation, between masks and
appropriate emblems of Liberty and Slavery.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>

<p>“Although all were unwilling to abandon this favorite plan of expressing
to Mr. Sumner by a substantial token their sympathy and their support,
yet they were of the opinion that his letter left them no choice in the matter,
and, after discussing many plans for the disposition of the funds already
raised, the suggestion of Mr. Sumner was unanimously adopted by the following
resolves.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Resolved</i>, That the Secretary of this meeting be instructed to subscribe
the amount of funds in his hands to aid the cause of <em>Freedom in Kansas</em>,
in the name of Hon. Charles Sumner.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Resolved</i>, That the subscribers be notified by the Secretary of the above
vote, and have leave to withdraw their subscriptions.’</p>

<p>“The amount already subscribed is one thousand dollars, and by the
action of the meeting Mr. Sumner’s noble and eloquent speech has ‘hardened
into deeds,’ for which we hope many a poor sufferer in Kansas will
long have occasion to bless his memory.”</p>

</div>

<p>The resolutions of the meeting were communicated to Mr. Sumner
by the Chairman in the following letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Cambridge</span>, June 25, 1856.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You have already been made acquainted with the
earnest movement of some of your host of friends in this quarter to convey
to you a tangible evidence of their profound esteem for your character, and
their enthusiastic admiration of your conduct. The arrival of your generous
letter stopped their proceedings. At your own request one thousand
dollars will go to Kansas instead of to you.</p>

<p>“At the public meeting where this decision was taken, I was directed,
as being Chairman, to acquaint you with the acquiescence of the subscribers
to the testimonial in your wishes, and to assure you that all your
motives in this act, and throughout the recent signal and portentous events,
are by us fully appreciated and honored. I will not add to your fatigues,
and to the crowd of communications which must be pouring in upon you,
by a long communication. Your name is inseparably and nobly associated
with the history of Freedom, in America and in the world, henceforth.
We confide in you for the future. We thank you for the past. We supplicate,
in your behalf, from the Almighty Source of Good a rapid restoration
of your health and strength, and ever-increasing powers of will, of faith, of
action, and of speech, in the infinite service of Humanity.</p>

<p>“You will believe, my dear Sir, that my personal feelings go undivided

would be morally grand on <em>both</em> sides.’ And Mr. Child answered: ‘Depend
upon it, he <em>will</em> do it. Nothing could be more characteristic of the man.’
That letter and Mr. Wilson’s answer to the challenge have revived my
early faith in human nature. It is impossible to calculate the salutary
influence of such examples.”</p>

at Canterbury in 1772. Boswell’s defence of the Slave-Trade was kindred
in character. (Life of Johnson, ed. Croker, London, 1848, Vol. VII.
pp. 23, 24, Sept. 23, 1777.) Nothing can be more melancholy than the
effort of Capitein the African, who, surrendering to the Dutch influences
about him, made himself the apologist of Slavery, in a Latin Dissertation,
translated into Dutch, and reprinted four times, entitled “<i>Dissertatio politico-theologica
de Servitute Libertati Christianæ non contraria</i>, quam sub Præside
J. Van den Honert publicæ Disquisitioni subjicit J. E. J. Capitein,
Afer, in 4to, Lugduni Batavorum, 1742.” In our own country, the Rev.
John Beck, of Georgia, dared to preach and print, in 1801, two sermons entitled
“The Doctrine of Perpetual Bondage reconcilable with the Infinite
Justice of God, a Truth plainly asserted in the Jewish and Christian Scripture.”
Good men must join in the thanks expressed to Colonel Humphreys
by the philanthropist Grégoire, for his exposure of this baseness in his Valedictory
Discourse before the Cincinnati of Connecticut. Grégoire, De la
Littérature des Nègres, p. 232.</p>
